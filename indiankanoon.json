    "content": "Why we started Indian Kanoon?\nIndia prides herself as the largest democracy in the world.  There are three\nbroad pillars of Indian democracy: the legislatures who make laws, the\nexecutives who enforce laws and the judiciary that interprets laws. The laws\nregulate a number of activities like criminal offense, civil cases, taxation,\ntrade, social welfare, education and labor rights.\nEven when laws empower citizens in a large number of ways, a significant\nfraction of the population is completely ignorant of their rights and\nprivileges.  As a result, common people are afraid of going to police and\nrarely go to court to seek justice.  People continue to live under fear of\nunknown laws and corrupt practices.\nA number of attempts have been made to bring the knowledge of law to the common\npeople. The Government of India took active efforts to present all laws along\nwith their amendments at indiacode.nic.in and all court judgments at\njudis.nic.in. Similar efforts have been taken up by other privately owned\nwebsites.\nWhile it is commendable to make law documents available to common people, it is\nstill quite difficult for common people to easily find the required\ninformation. The first problem is that acts are very large and in most\nscenarios just a few section of laws are applicable.  Finding most applicable\nsections from hundreds of pages of law documents is too daunting for common\npeople.  Secondly, laws are often vague and one needs to see how they have been\ninterpreted by the judicial courts.  Currently, the laws and judgments are\nseparately maintained and to find judgments that interpret certain law clauses\nis difficult.\nIn order to remove the above two structural problems, Indian Kanoon is started.\nIt achieves them by breaking law documents into smallest possible clause and by\nintegrating law/statutes with court judgments.  A tight integration of court\njudgments with laws and with themselves allows automatic determination of the\nmost relevant clauses and court judgments. Hope Indian Kanoon helps you in your\nsearch for Indian laws and their interpretations.\nWhy is my court case on the Internet?",

    "content": "Why is google/yahoo showing court judgments from Indian Kanoon?\nIndian Kanoon has been useful for people seeking information on Indian Law.\nOver time Indian Kanoon's reputation on general search engines like google and\nyahoo has improved and as a result, pages from Indian Kanoon have started\nsurfacing in the top few of search results.\nCourt Cases Are Public Records\nCourt judgments are public records. If a case is heard by a court of India,\nno one can argue that the opinion should not be published and viewable by all,\nunless the court itself expressly says it cannot be published or a law says it\ncannot be.\nThe decisions of the Supreme Court are the law of the land, and all citizens\ncan read their decisions. Not just the Supreme Court, courts today are\npublishing their judgments and orders on the Internet. If you search for a\ncurrent court case from judis.nic.in or a high court website or the district\ncourt websites, you will find details of that case directly from the\ncourts.\nWho gave permission to Indian Kanoon to publish court cases?\nAs mentioned above, Court cases are public records and we do not need\nanyone's permission to publish court cases. The Section 52(1)(q)(iv) of the\nCopyright Act states that publication of court judgments does not\nconstitute an infringement of Copyright.\nBut my privacy is violated by publication of court judgment\nIn R. Rajagopal vs State Of\nT.N on 7 October, 1994 where the Supreme Court defined the scope of the Right to Privacy , it held that publication of court records will not\nconstitute any violation of the right to privacy. It held:\nBut the recent Supreme Court judgment on Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017) gives me right to privacy?\nPuttaswamy vs Union of India (2017) recognizes the right to privacy as an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty\nunder Article 21 of the Constitution . It expressly held that the\nrecognition of the right to be forgotten would require careful balancing with\nother legitimate State interests, including the right to freedom of\ninformation, through a legislative enactment governing data protection. In\nfact, it expressly referred and endorsed R. Rajagopal (supra) in relation to\npublic records. So R. Rajgopal (supra) is the binding law till it is over ruled\nby the Supreme Court.\nWhat about the recent orders in Jorawar Singh Mundy case etc?\nThere are some interim orders ordering us for for name removal and we have complied with them. However, there are only two final orders in the right to be forgotten cases before the high courts. In Dharamraj Bhanushankar Dave v. State of Gujarat , the Hon'ble High Court held that the petitioner was unable to provide any violation of the law by way of the publication of the court judgment that can be addressed under Article 226.  It also held that publishing of any judgment or proceeding on a website\nwould not come under the realm of ‘reportable’ as understood\nin context of judgments reported in a law reporter.\nThe division bench of Kerala High Court, in the case of Dr.Krishna Menon vs High Court Of Kerala , has duly\nnoted that “Reporting and publishing judgments are part of freedom of speech\nand expression and that cannot be taken away lightly without the aid of the\nlaw.” The Kerala High Court has struck a balance between the right to privacy\nand the right to freedom of information by holding that the \"right to be\nforgotten\" cannot be exercised in criminal law cases and current/recent cases.\nThough it could be exercised on a case-to-case basis with respect to\nmatrimonial/family cases etc which we already block. The court said:  \"We have\nalready overruled the right to claim privacy in the public sphere in an Open\nCourt system. The Courtroom is open to all. The Court cannot gloss over the\nprotection available to publishers of judgments under Article 19(1)(a).\"\nCan you remove or modify my court case?\nWe will not remove or modify any public documents without an order of the\ncourt competent to do so. Remember, there are many, many copies of these court\ndecisions in existence, and Indian Kanoon has just one of those many copies.\nIn a limited set of cases, we will remove the name, address and any other\nidentity of the victim from the court judgments for cases registered under\nSection 376 IPC, Section 376A-D, Section 354 IPC or the Sexual Harassment of\nWomen at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. You can\nsend an email to [email protected] with the link/URL of the case on\nIndian Kanoon.\nIn accordance with the provisions of Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, we will remove any identity disclosure of a juvenile in conflict of law inadvertantly done in a court order unless such removal is explicitly prohibited by a Juvenile Board or a Committee, specially constituted for the purpose that allows for such a disclosure to be made.\nCan you at least block Google/Yahoo from accessing my judgment?\nYes but only for cases of divorce, maintenance, child adoption and child\ncustody. The cases from the Supreme Court will not be blocked. Send an email to [email protected] with the link/URL of the case on Indian Kanoon. The\nrequests are examined in a batch once 2-3 weeks and will take time. Also note\nthat only \"/doc/ \" and \"/docfragment/ \" will be blocked from the\nsearch engines.

The court judgments are downloaded by a crawler at night, so that we do not affect the working of court websites. The judgements and orders are then added in the early morning. We try to update laws and regulations regularly but our updates may be delayed from the date of notification of such laws. Due care has been taken to make the database reliable and error-free, but we disclaim any liability arising out of any inadvertent errors in the database. Use of this website, by implication, means that you have gone through and agreed to abide by the Terms and Conditions and the Disclaimers of this website.\nSince we are a public facing website, we may remove or modify court orders or judgments in the following very rare circumstances:\nWhen the jurisdictional court orders us to do so.\nRemoval of victim identity and replacing them by tags like {Name-redacted}, {Addr-redacted}, {Age-redacted} etc in cases registered under Section 376 IPC, Section 376A-D, Section 354 IPC or the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.\nRemoval of the identifying details of Juveniles in compliance with Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.\nFor more details, read our case removal policy .",

The structural analysis dashboard allows to select categories of the order one is interested in.\nIt is a machine learned model which automatically segments a document into the above mentioned categories for user convenience. You can select \"Mark Above Structure\" which automatically marks various segments of the judgment in different colours, or you can select individual categories for reading only the selected portion. This saves your valuable time while reading lengthy texts and helps in efficient analysis!\nReliability of Precedents\nEvery document on Indian Kanoon that consists of case laws citing within it will have a feature on top that will extract all the discussion around that case law and categorize the opinion of the court. The categories for labeling a cite-text are - Relied by Party, Accepted by Court, Negatively viewed by Court and No clear sentiment . You can \"Mark all Cite Text\" which highlights all cited text in the document along with its sentiment or you can select one of the categories. This helps immensely for identifying quickly the precedents matching your needs!\nJudges filter (Author and Bench) and Tag Search\nNow you can filter your search results by judges, also can select Author or Bench and have additional Law based filters to focus on judgments of your interest. With further filters based on \"Court Type\", \"Year\", \"Document type\" and \"Related queries\" your research potential will be unmatched!\nWe have successfully resolved 2200 judges that includes all Supreme Court judges and also all the High Court judges post 2008. We hyperlink court judgments that the judges have authored or were part of the bench. Along with this we editorially created tags for all major laws of India and court judgments.\nAdvanced Search\nPlease watch the video below on how to use the advances search and the various options available to control your search\nWord and Phrase search: Indian Kanoon allows you to look for words and\nphrases in the  main document text and in the title of documents. Some words\nthat you may like to search are freedom of speech, murder, copyright\ninfringement, proclamation of emergency, reservation for other backward class,\nreservation in private colleges, and sexual harassment. For phrases,\nenclose a set of words by quotation marks. For example, in order to search for\nphrase freedom of speech in the document/title text, you need to type \"freedom of speech\" in the document/title text box.\nOperators: Beside phrase search, words can be combined by ANDD, ORR and NOTT opertors. So a search for 'murder ORR kidnapping' will search for documents that have either the word 'murder' or the word 'kidnapping'. Similarly, a search for 'murder ANDD NOTT kidnapping' will look for documents that have the word 'murder' but not the word 'kidnapping'. ANDD is implicit when used with a series of words. So 'murder kidnapping' is effectively 'murder ANDD kidnapping'. Note that the operators ANDD, ORR and NOTT are case sensitive and require at least one space at both start and end.\nRstricting search by document types: By default, Indian Kanoon will\nquery all documents and try to find out the most appropriate section/article,\nsubsection or sub-subsection to a particular query. However, Indian Kanoon may\nsometimes give you terrible results.  In this case, you can narrow your result\nset by selecting only the set of documents that you are interested in.\nThe document selection allows you to target your query to only a narrow set of\ndocuments. A law passed by the Parliament of India is divided into\nsection/article, subsection and sub-subsection.  For example, Constitution of\nIndia will be available as the complete document, articles like Article 19\n(protection of certain rights), subsection as Article 19(1) (all citizens have\nthe rights) and sub-subsection as Article 19(1)(a) as (freedom of speech and\nexpression).\nRestricting search by date: Normal search will look for documents on all\npossible dates. You can restrict the dates by going in advanced search and\nchanging the fromdate and todate. If one of them is left unchanged, fromdate\ndefaults to minimum possible date and todate defaults to maximum possible date.\nTitle and Citation Search: A search on the main box will automatically\nquery the titles and the citations (like \"1977 AIR 1579\"). The documents with\ntitle and citation match will surface to the top. However, if one wants to\nrestrict the search to only documents that match words or phrases in title, one\ncan use the \"title:\" filter. For example, to only look for documents that have\nkesavananda in the title, one can use the type \"title: kesavananda\" in the main\nsearch bar. Similarly, to search only for documents that have 1993 AIR citation\none can use \"cite: 1993 AIR\".\nAuthor and Bench search: One may also like to look for documents written by a particular judge. In order to restrict to judgments that are written by a particular judge, one can use the \"author:\" filter. For example, to look for judgments written only by arijit pasayat, type \"author: arijit pasayat\" on the main box. Similarly, the \"bench:\" filter allows you to restrict judgments that have only the given judge in the bench. For example, to find judgments in which \"Arijit pasayat\" has been on the bench, type \"bench: arijit pasayat\" on the search box.\n\nTable:\nAccessto the entire database consisting of court orders/judgments and the laws from the Union of India, the States and the Union territories. | Virtual Legal Assistantallows you take notes as you read legal documents, allowing you to quickly assemble research on any matter.
