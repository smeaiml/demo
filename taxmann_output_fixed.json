Its creation followed the Union Finance Minister's 2005\u201306 Budget announcement, which called for an institution dedicated to teaching, training, and conducting research in the securities markets.\nGuided by its vision to 'lead, catalyse, and deliver educational initiatives that enhance the quality of securities markets,' NISM offers a spectrum of capacity-building programs, ranging from basic financial literacy workshops to full-time postgraduate courses. Six Schools of Excellence drive its mission: the School for Certification of Intermediaries, the School for Securities Education, the School for Investor Education and Financial Literacy, the School for Regulatory Studies and Supervision, the School for Corporate Governance, and the School for Securities Information and Research. These Schools collaborate to further professionalise the securities markets.\nUnder SEBI (Certification of Associated Persons in the Securities Markets) Regulations, 2007, NISM is tasked with conducting certification examinations and continuing professional education programs for individuals engaged by intermediaries. It also administers certification exams for other regulators, such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). NISM's certifications serve as a comprehensive benchmark for knowledge across various functions in India's securities markets, enabling professionals to enhance their expertise and skills.\nCustomers Reviews\n5 43 %\n4 43 %\n3 14 %\n2 0 %\n1 0 %\nMutual Fund Foundation\nENGLISH\n2018\nPrint book\ngood\nJatin Hathiyani | Jun 3, 2019\nnice\nMutual Fund Foundation-September 2016\nENGLISH\n2017\nPrint book\nMutual Fund Foundation by NiSM\nanil vanjari | Jun 10, 2018\nThis book is printed in 2017 and many changes have been taking place in this area of investment.

It provides a 'section-by-section' analysis, focusing on the legislative intent behind each provision. The book features an exhaustive tabular comparison of the new and old legal frameworks, helping readers easily identify changes and continuities and ensuring a smooth transition to the new legal regime.\nIts well-structured layout allows quick access to information, catering to broad overviews and in-depth study. Published by Taxmann, this guide upholds its tradition of delivering high-quality legal publications, making it an essential resource for understanding and applying India's new criminal laws.\nThis book is helpful for legal professionals, providing a detailed section analysis and comparison tables for effective practice. Law enforcement officers benefit from its procedural clarity, while academicians and students find it a valuable resource for studying and teaching the new laws. Government officials and policymakers will also appreciate its depth and clarity for policy formulation and implementation.\nThe Present Publication is the 2025 Edition, authored by Taxmann's Editorial Board, with the following noteworthy features:\nExhaustive \u2018Section-by-Section\u2019 Analysis\nThe book provides a detailed section-by-section breakdown of the three major new laws, i.e. BNS, BNSS and BSA, replacing the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and Indian Evidence Act. Each section is analysed to clarify the new provisions, their scope, and practical implications. The commentary is aimed at aiding legal professionals in interpreting and applying the new laws effectively\nDetailed Tabular Comparisons\nThis book includes tabular comparisons between the old laws (IPC, CrPC, and Indian Evidence Act) and the new laws (BNS, BNSS, and BSA). These tables help readers quickly identify the changes, including reworded sections, renumbered provisions, and newly introduced concepts. The comparison tables are handy for practitioners transitioning from the old legal framework to the new one, as they highlight the continuity and differences between the two sets of laws\nUser-Centric Organisation\nThe book is divided into three primary divisions\nDivision One | Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 , which addresses substantive criminal law, including general exceptions, offences, and punishments\nDivision Two | Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 , which deals with procedural law, outlining the criminal procedures to be followed from investigation through trial and appeal\nDivision Three | Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 , which focuses on the law of evidence, detailing the rules and principles governing the admissibility, relevance, and evaluation of evidence in criminal cases\nEach division includes an arrangement of sections, a subject index, and guides that provide a roadmap for navigating the extensive content\nComparative Tables of Sections\nAt the end of each division, the book provides comprehensive tables showing the old laws' sections (IPC, CrPC, and Indian Evidence Act) alongside the corresponding sections in the new laws (BNS, BNSS, BSA). This feature is instrumental in helping readers understand how specific provisions have been modified, relocated, or replaced. For example, sections from the IPC are matched with their counterparts in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, showing the continuity or changes in the legislative approach\nAuthoritative Commentary\nThe book provides an authoritative commentary on each section, enriched with analyses of the legislative intent behind the new laws. This commentary not only explains the text of the law but also contextualises it within the broader framework of Indian criminal jurisprudence\nPractical Utility\nDesigned with the needs of legal practitioners in mind, this Ready Reckoner is a practical tool for day-to-day legal work. It serves as a quick reference guide during court proceedings, client consultations, and legal research\nAbout the author\nTaxmann's Editorial Board\nAt the core of Taxmann's commitment to delivering insightful and reliable information is a highly skilled Research & Editorial Team consisting of Chartered Accountants, Company Secretaries, and Lawyers.

The budget includes revenue and expenditure projections, as well as proposed changes to taxes and government policies. Businesses, investors, and citizens closely watch the union budget as it can significantly impact the country's economy.\nWhat is a Capital Budget?\nA capital budget is a financial plan that outlines the government's proposed spending on long-term investments, such as infrastructure projects, buildings, equipment, etc. This budget is separate from the operating budget, which covers the government's day-to-day expenses, such as salaries and office supplies. Capital budgets are used to plan and finance large-scale investments that significantly impact the economy and society. This includes the construction of roads, bridges, airports, schools, hospitals, etc. These projects are expected to generate income over a while, and the return on the investment is expected to be higher than the cost.\nWhat is a Revenue Budget?\nA revenue budget is a financial plan that outlines the government's projected revenue and expenses for a specific time, typically a fiscal year. The revenue budget is focused on the government's day-to-day operations. It includes the revenue expected to be generated through taxes and other sources, as well as the expenses required to run the government's operations. The budget is used to plan the government's financial resources and ensure sufficient money is available to cover its expenses. The budget also includes revenue estimates from various sources such as taxes, non-tax revenue, grants, etc. The budget is a plan for the government to allocate resources and manage its finances efficiently and effectively.\nWhat are the Sources of Tax Revenues?\nThe primary sources of tax revenue for the government are: Income Tax \u2013 This is a tax on the income earned by individuals, businesses, and other organizations GST (Goods and Services Tax) \u2013 GST is an indirect tax that is levied on the supply of goods and services Sales Tax \u2013 This is a tax on the sale of certain goods. It is also known as a value-added tax (VAT) Excise Tax \u2013 This is a tax on the manufacture or sale of specific goods, such as alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline Customs Duties \u2013 This is a tax on goods imported into a country These are the main sources of tax revenue for the government.\nIncome Tax \u2013 This is a tax on the income earned by individuals, businesses, and other organizations\nGST (Goods and Services Tax) \u2013 GST is an indirect tax that is levied on the supply of goods and services\nSales Tax \u2013 This is a tax on the sale of certain goods.

These expenses are typically unrelated to long-term investments and do not create assets. Some examples of revenue expenditures include: Salaries and wages for government employees Interest payments on government debt Administrative costs such as rent, office supplies, and equipment Social welfare programs such as unemployment benefits and food assistance Maintenance costs for government buildings and infrastructure Defence expenses such as military personnel and equipment Law enforcement and public safety expenses Education and healthcare expenses Public transportation expenses Environmental protection expenses These are just a few examples of the many types of revenue expenditures that the government incurs. In general, revenue expenditures are considered ongoing expenses necessary for the government's functioning and the delivery of public services.\nSalaries and wages for government employees\nInterest payments on government debt\nAdministrative costs such as rent, office supplies, and equipment\nSocial welfare programs such as unemployment benefits and food assistance\nMaintenance costs for government buildings and infrastructure\nDefence expenses such as military personnel and equipment\nLaw enforcement and public safety expenses\nEducation and healthcare expenses\nPublic transportation expenses\nEnvironmental protection expenses\nWhat is a Fiscal Deficit?\nFiscal deficit refers to the gap between the government's total revenue (from taxes and other sources) and its total expenditure in a fiscal year. It is an indicator of the government's financial health and measures how much it needs to borrow to finance its expenses. Fiscal deficit is calculated as the difference between the government's total expenditure (including capital and revenue expenditure) and its total revenue (including tax and non-tax revenue) in a financial year. If the government's total expenditure exceeds its total revenue, it results in a fiscal deficit that must be financed through borrowings. A high fiscal deficit can lead to an increase in government debt and inflation if not appropriately managed.\nWhat is a Finance Bill?\nThe Finance Bill is introduced in the Indian parliament along with the Union Budget and contains detailed proposals for new taxes and changes to existing tax laws. The bill is presented by the finance minister and is passed by the parliament after a detailed discussion and debate. The Finance Bill provides the legal framework for the budget and sets out the government's tax proposals for the upcoming fiscal year. It also includes measures to implement the government's budget policies and proposals. The parliament passes the bill and then becomes the Finance Act, which enacts the tax proposals and changes the tax laws.

Pranav Jain\n\nI'm honoured to have been associated with Taxmann as a speaker. Their platform is a\n        treasure trove of knowledge, offering ease of access,\n        comprehensive content and interactive features.

Rohit Vaswani\nFCA, LLM, CMA, DISA (ICAI), LLB, B.Com\nEducation and learning are endless journeys, especially in tax matters, where fast-paced\n        changes have significant revenue implications if not addressed in time.\n        The demand for continuing education on contemporary issues far exceeds what formal\n        academics can offer. Taxmann's initiative to align subject experts on a digital platform with\n        global reach is commendable and unmatched.\n        This ecosystem will benefit trade, industry, and professionals if nurtured consistently while\n        paving the way for cost-effective, highly specialised knowledge dissemination.\n        As part of Taxmann's faculty on GST, I congratulate the team and wish them continued\n        success in their journey.\nCA. Harshal Bhuta, LL.M.\nPartner | P.R. Bhuta & Co.\nTaxmann's learning platform is an excellent initiative for hosting webinars and workshops\n        on impactful topics for all stakeholders.\n        I especially appreciate their proactive approach to introducing sessions on pressing issues. As\n        a speaker, I found the platform user-friendly and experienced no technical difficulties during\n        my live sessions.\nShri. D.C. Patwari, IRS\nFormer Pr. CCIT & DGIT (Inv.)\nBy being in the IRS and serving in the Income Tax department for 36 years in different\n        capacities, I was familiar with Taxmann and used its resources in my daily work life. Its vast\n        coverage of various issues and analysis of judicial decisions through an efficient retrieval\n        system has immensely benefited not just tax professionals and taxpayers but also the tax\n        department. \n\n        After I retired from Pr. CCIT, in late 2022, I decided to share my knowledge and experience\n        on investigation, litigation, etc., through a reliable platform. I chose Taxmann, as it is the best\n        and the most equipped platform for tax professionals and taxpayers alike.\n\n        In my first Taxmann webinar on search and seizure, I reached more than 2,000 attendees,\n        which was remarkable. I led several more webinars, including a masterclass, which were\n        well-received and grand successes. As a speaker, I got ample support from Team Taxmann,\n        enabling me to focus entirely on content.\n\n        I am confident that webinars conducted by Taxmann create tremendous value for thousands\n        of subscribers. Moreover, their post-webinar YouTube videos serve as lifetime resources for\n        people.\n\n        If I have to sum it up in one sentence, Taxmann is a one-stop solution for everything related\n        to legal, taxation, and litigation. Best wishes to them and their ever-increasing audience.\nCA. Daksha Baxi\nFounder | SRI Solutions\nIt was a wonderful experience preparing for the masterclass on International Taxation,\n        dealing with the whole spectrum of insights pertaining to bilateral treaties, mainly tax treaties\n        known as Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) or Tax Conventions. I truly\n        enjoyed using my experience of many years of professional work in this area to give a\n        realistic perspective of what Tax Conventions are, their genesis, and their journey from the\n        early days till now, and explaining each aspect along with examples, case studies, and\n        relevant judicial precedents.\n\n        I genuinely wish young professionals and those in cross-border transactions, trade, and\n        commerce to gain these insights. I hope I could largely meet this expectation, knowing there\n        can always be more to give.\n\n        Cramming the entire text of a DTAA into six sessions, aggregating 18 hours, only allows one\n        to scrape the surface. Still, the intention has been for participants to gain a genuine and good\n        introduction to the DTAA, their application, their relationship with domestic tax law, and\n        how they are viewed between contracting countries and internationally. Comparing 9 DTAAs\n        (of the 93 that India has entered into) along with the UN and the OECD Model Conventions\n        gave an excellent insight into the role of the Model Convention as well as the role of\n        negotiations and the need for specific provisions to develop bilateral trade and commerce in\n        the DTAAs.\nAdv. Shankey Agrawal\nPartner | BMR Legal Advocates\nI had the privilege of speaking on the Taxmann platform, which was an incredibly\n        rewarding experience. The platform is an excellent resource for professionals and students,\n        offering many tools, insights, and up-to-date information on tax and legal issues.\n        Taxmann's commitment to providing high-quality content empowers learners to enhance their\n        expertise and apply their knowledge effectively in real-world scenarios.\n\n        It's been a pleasure to contribute, and I am confident that Taxmann will continue to impact\n        tax professionals significantly.\nCA. Niki Shah\nPartner | SN & Co.\nThank you for inviting me to be a speaker on your platform. Sharing insights with your\n        engaged and enthusiastic audience was an absolute pleasure. \n\n        Your platform's commitment to delivering high-quality learning experiences is\n        commendable. The seamless coordination and interactive audience made the session both\n        impactful and rewarding.\n\n        As a speaker, I felt valued and supported throughout the process, and it's evident that your\n        team prioritises learner engagement and enrichment. This platform is an excellent avenue for\n        professionals to gain practical knowledge and enhance their expertise.\n\n        I would be happy to collaborate in the future and strongly recommend your platform to\n        anyone seeking structured and impactful learning experiences.\nCA. A. Jatin Christopher\nPartner | JCSS & Associates\nLearning is sporadic because, outside the formal education system, it is unstructured and\n        closely linked to occupational needs. When topical learning becomes a vital part of\n        continuous education, regular knowledge-sharing by practitioners can bring immense value.\n        Taxmann, committed to regulatory publications, has taken it upon itself to facilitate learning\n        through its online platform. \n\n        Having had the opportunity to contribute as a resource person, my best wishes to Team\n        Taxmann to continue this impactful work.\nCA. Natwar Thakrar\nPartner | N.G. Thakrar & Co. Chartered Accountants\nIt has been a pleasure and an honour to be a speaker for Taxmann's webinars on FEMA and\n        international taxation. \n\n        The topics are selected after detailed deliberations based on current developments and\n        audience needs, ensuring maximum benefit for participants and immense satisfaction for\n        speakers.\n\n        As opportunities arise, I look forward to participating in future webinars, workshops, and\n        masterclasses.\nCA. Aanchal Kapoor\n\nI had the privilege of speaking on Taxmann, India's preeminent tax platform, and it was an\n        enriching experience. \n\n        The platform's unwavering commitment to providing high-quality content and expert insights\n        is commendable. The seamless organisation and coordination of events by the Taxmann team\n        allowed me to focus on delivering my best. \n\n        The audience was engaged and knowledgeable, making the interaction highly rewarding.

Bhuta & Co.\nTaxmann's learning platform is an excellent initiative for hosting webinars and workshops\n        on impactful topics for all stakeholders.\n        I especially appreciate their proactive approach to introducing sessions on pressing issues. As\n        a speaker, I found the platform user-friendly and experienced no technical difficulties during\n        my live sessions.\nShri. D.C. Patwari, IRS\nFormer Pr. CCIT & DGIT (Inv.)\nBy being in the IRS and serving in the Income Tax department for 36 years in different\n        capacities, I was familiar with Taxmann and used its resources in my daily work life. Its vast\n        coverage of various issues and analysis of judicial decisions through an efficient retrieval\n        system has immensely benefited not just tax professionals and taxpayers but also the tax\n        department. \n\n        After I retired from Pr. CCIT, in late 2022, I decided to share my knowledge and experience\n        on investigation, litigation, etc., through a reliable platform. I chose Taxmann, as it is the best\n        and the most equipped platform for tax professionals and taxpayers alike.\n\n        In my first Taxmann webinar on search and seizure, I reached more than 2,000 attendees,\n        which was remarkable. I led several more webinars, including a masterclass, which were\n        well-received and grand successes. As a speaker, I got ample support from Team Taxmann,\n        enabling me to focus entirely on content.\n\n        I am confident that webinars conducted by Taxmann create tremendous value for thousands\n        of subscribers. Moreover, their post-webinar YouTube videos serve as lifetime resources for\n        people.\n\n        If I have to sum it up in one sentence, Taxmann is a one-stop solution for everything related\n        to legal, taxation, and litigation. Best wishes to them and their ever-increasing audience.\nCA. Daksha Baxi\nFounder | SRI Solutions\nIt was a wonderful experience preparing for the masterclass on International Taxation,\n        dealing with the whole spectrum of insights pertaining to bilateral treaties, mainly tax treaties\n        known as Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) or Tax Conventions. I truly\n        enjoyed using my experience of many years of professional work in this area to give a\n        realistic perspective of what Tax Conventions are, their genesis, and their journey from the\n        early days till now, and explaining each aspect along with examples, case studies, and\n        relevant judicial precedents.\n\n        I genuinely wish young professionals and those in cross-border transactions, trade, and\n        commerce to gain these insights. I hope I could largely meet this expectation, knowing there\n        can always be more to give.\n\n        Cramming the entire text of a DTAA into six sessions, aggregating 18 hours, only allows one\n        to scrape the surface. Still, the intention has been for participants to gain a genuine and good\n        introduction to the DTAA, their application, their relationship with domestic tax law, and\n        how they are viewed between contracting countries and internationally. Comparing 9 DTAAs\n        (of the 93 that India has entered into) along with the UN and the OECD Model Conventions\n        gave an excellent insight into the role of the Model Convention as well as the role of\n        negotiations and the need for specific provisions to develop bilateral trade and commerce in\n        the DTAAs.\nAdv. Shankey Agrawal\nPartner | BMR Legal Advocates\nI had the privilege of speaking on the Taxmann platform, which was an incredibly\n        rewarding experience. The platform is an excellent resource for professionals and students,\n        offering many tools, insights, and up-to-date information on tax and legal issues.\n        Taxmann's commitment to providing high-quality content empowers learners to enhance their\n        expertise and apply their knowledge effectively in real-world scenarios.\n\n        It's been a pleasure to contribute, and I am confident that Taxmann will continue to impact\n        tax professionals significantly.\nCA. Niki Shah\nPartner | SN & Co.\nThank you for inviting me to be a speaker on your platform. Sharing insights with your\n        engaged and enthusiastic audience was an absolute pleasure. \n\n        Your platform's commitment to delivering high-quality learning experiences is\n        commendable. The seamless coordination and interactive audience made the session both\n        impactful and rewarding.\n\n        As a speaker, I felt valued and supported throughout the process, and it's evident that your\n        team prioritises learner engagement and enrichment. This platform is an excellent avenue for\n        professionals to gain practical knowledge and enhance their expertise.\n\n        I would be happy to collaborate in the future and strongly recommend your platform to\n        anyone seeking structured and impactful learning experiences.\nCA. A. Jatin Christopher\nPartner | JCSS & Associates\nLearning is sporadic because, outside the formal education system, it is unstructured and\n        closely linked to occupational needs. When topical learning becomes a vital part of\n        continuous education, regular knowledge-sharing by practitioners can bring immense value.\n        Taxmann, committed to regulatory publications, has taken it upon itself to facilitate learning\n        through its online platform. \n\n        Having had the opportunity to contribute as a resource person, my best wishes to Team\n        Taxmann to continue this impactful work.\nCA. Natwar Thakrar\nPartner | N.G. Thakrar & Co. Chartered Accountants\nIt has been a pleasure and an honour to be a speaker for Taxmann's webinars on FEMA and\n        international taxation. \n\n        The topics are selected after detailed deliberations based on current developments and\n        audience needs, ensuring maximum benefit for participants and immense satisfaction for\n        speakers.\n\n        As opportunities arise, I look forward to participating in future webinars, workshops, and\n        masterclasses.\nCA. Aanchal Kapoor\n\nI had the privilege of speaking on Taxmann, India's preeminent tax platform, and it was an\n        enriching experience. \n\n        The platform's unwavering commitment to providing high-quality content and expert insights\n        is commendable. The seamless organisation and coordination of events by the Taxmann team\n        allowed me to focus on delivering my best. \n\n        The audience was engaged and knowledgeable, making the interaction highly rewarding. The\n        platform's esteemed reputation and broad reach made it an ideal stage to showcase my\n        expertise and connect with like-minded professionals. \n\n        My experience was exceptional, and I look forward to future collaborations. I highly\n        recommend this platform to anyone looking to share their expertise and connect with India's\n        tax community.\nAdv. Nipun P. Singhvi\nPracticing Advocate\nTaxmann's platform is a wonderful space for practical learning from subject experts. I have\n        had the opportunity to be both a speaker and an audience member on the platform. \n\n        My experience has been rewarding, helping me explore uncharted areas and expand my\n        professional practice.\n\n        I congratulate the team and wish them continued success.\nCA.

Harshal Bhuta, LL.M.\nPartner | P.R.

As\n        a speaker, I found the platform user-friendly and experienced no technical difficulties during\n        my live sessions.\nShri. D.C. Patwari, IRS\nFormer Pr. CCIT & DGIT (Inv.)\nBy being in the IRS and serving in the Income Tax department for 36 years in different\n        capacities, I was familiar with Taxmann and used its resources in my daily work life. Its vast\n        coverage of various issues and analysis of judicial decisions through an efficient retrieval\n        system has immensely benefited not just tax professionals and taxpayers but also the tax\n        department. \n\n        After I retired from Pr. CCIT, in late 2022, I decided to share my knowledge and experience\n        on investigation, litigation, etc., through a reliable platform. I chose Taxmann, as it is the best\n        and the most equipped platform for tax professionals and taxpayers alike.\n\n        In my first Taxmann webinar on search and seizure, I reached more than 2,000 attendees,\n        which was remarkable.

Best wishes to them and their ever-increasing audience.\nCA. Daksha Baxi\nFounder | SRI Solutions\nIt was a wonderful experience preparing for the masterclass on International Taxation,\n        dealing with the whole spectrum of insights pertaining to bilateral treaties, mainly tax treaties\n        known as Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) or Tax Conventions. I truly\n        enjoyed using my experience of many years of professional work in this area to give a\n        realistic perspective of what Tax Conventions are, their genesis, and their journey from the\n        early days till now, and explaining each aspect along with examples, case studies, and\n        relevant judicial precedents.\n\n        I genuinely wish young professionals and those in cross-border transactions, trade, and\n        commerce to gain these insights. I hope I could largely meet this expectation, knowing there\n        can always be more to give.\n\n        Cramming the entire text of a DTAA into six sessions, aggregating 18 hours, only allows one\n        to scrape the surface. Still, the intention has been for participants to gain a genuine and good\n        introduction to the DTAA, their application, their relationship with domestic tax law, and\n        how they are viewed between contracting countries and internationally. Comparing 9 DTAAs\n        (of the 93 that India has entered into) along with the UN and the OECD Model Conventions\n        gave an excellent insight into the role of the Model Convention as well as the role of\n        negotiations and the need for specific provisions to develop bilateral trade and commerce in\n        the DTAAs.\nAdv.

Singhvi\nPracticing Advocate\nTaxmann's platform is a wonderful space for practical learning from subject experts. I have\n        had the opportunity to be both a speaker and an audience member on the platform. \n\n        My experience has been rewarding, helping me explore uncharted areas and expand my\n        professional practice.\n\n        I congratulate the team and wish them continued success.\nCA. Pranav Jain\n\nI'm honoured to have been associated with Taxmann as a speaker. Their platform is a\n        treasure trove of knowledge, offering ease of access,\n        comprehensive content and interactive features. An exceptional learning platform for professionals and students, empowering growth and\n        success. Kudos to Taxmann.com.\nCA. Rohit Vaswani\nFCA, LLM, CMA, DISA (ICAI), LLB, B.Com\nEducation and learning are endless journeys, especially in tax matters, where fast-paced\n        changes have significant revenue implications if not addressed in time.\n        The demand for continuing education on contemporary issues far exceeds what formal\n        academics can offer. Taxmann's initiative to align subject experts on a digital platform with\n        global reach is commendable and unmatched.\n        This ecosystem will benefit trade, industry, and professionals if nurtured consistently while\n        paving the way for cost-effective, highly specialised knowledge dissemination.\n        As part of Taxmann's faculty on GST, I congratulate the team and wish them continued\n        success in their journey.\nCA. Harshal Bhuta, LL.M.\nPartner | P.R. Bhuta & Co.\nTaxmann's learning platform is an excellent initiative for hosting webinars and workshops\n        on impactful topics for all stakeholders.\n        I especially appreciate their proactive approach to introducing sessions on pressing issues. As\n        a speaker, I found the platform user-friendly and experienced no technical difficulties during\n        my live sessions.\nShri. D.C. Patwari, IRS\nFormer Pr. CCIT & DGIT (Inv.)\nBy being in the IRS and serving in the Income Tax department for 36 years in different\n        capacities, I was familiar with Taxmann and used its resources in my daily work life. Its vast\n        coverage of various issues and analysis of judicial decisions through an efficient retrieval\n        system has immensely benefited not just tax professionals and taxpayers but also the tax\n        department. \n\n        After I retired from Pr. CCIT, in late 2022, I decided to share my knowledge and experience\n        on investigation, litigation, etc., through a reliable platform. I chose Taxmann, as it is the best\n        and the most equipped platform for tax professionals and taxpayers alike.\n\n        In my first Taxmann webinar on search and seizure, I reached more than 2,000 attendees,\n        which was remarkable. I led several more webinars, including a masterclass, which were\n        well-received and grand successes. As a speaker, I got ample support from Team Taxmann,\n        enabling me to focus entirely on content.\n\n        I am confident that webinars conducted by Taxmann create tremendous value for thousands\n        of subscribers. Moreover, their post-webinar YouTube videos serve as lifetime resources for\n        people.\n\n        If I have to sum it up in one sentence, Taxmann is a one-stop solution for everything related\n        to legal, taxation, and litigation. Best wishes to them and their ever-increasing audience.\nCA. Daksha Baxi\nFounder | SRI Solutions\nIt was a wonderful experience preparing for the masterclass on International Taxation,\n        dealing with the whole spectrum of insights pertaining to bilateral treaties, mainly tax treaties\n        known as Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) or Tax Conventions. I truly\n        enjoyed using my experience of many years of professional work in this area to give a\n        realistic perspective of what Tax Conventions are, their genesis, and their journey from the\n        early days till now, and explaining each aspect along with examples, case studies, and\n        relevant judicial precedents.\n\n        I genuinely wish young professionals and those in cross-border transactions, trade, and\n        commerce to gain these insights. I hope I could largely meet this expectation, knowing there\n        can always be more to give.\n\n        Cramming the entire text of a DTAA into six sessions, aggregating 18 hours, only allows one\n        to scrape the surface. Still, the intention has been for participants to gain a genuine and good\n        introduction to the DTAA, their application, their relationship with domestic tax law, and\n        how they are viewed between contracting countries and internationally. Comparing 9 DTAAs\n        (of the 93 that India has entered into) along with the UN and the OECD Model Conventions\n        gave an excellent insight into the role of the Model Convention as well as the role of\n        negotiations and the need for specific provisions to develop bilateral trade and commerce in\n        the DTAAs.\nAdv. Shankey Agrawal\nPartner | BMR Legal Advocates\nI had the privilege of speaking on the Taxmann platform, which was an incredibly\n        rewarding experience. The platform is an excellent resource for professionals and students,\n        offering many tools, insights, and up-to-date information on tax and legal issues.\n        Taxmann's commitment to providing high-quality content empowers learners to enhance their\n        expertise and apply their knowledge effectively in real-world scenarios.\n\n        It's been a pleasure to contribute, and I am confident that Taxmann will continue to impact\n        tax professionals significantly.\nCA. Niki Shah\nPartner | SN & Co.\nThank you for inviting me to be a speaker on your platform. Sharing insights with your\n        engaged and enthusiastic audience was an absolute pleasure. \n\n        Your platform's commitment to delivering high-quality learning experiences is\n        commendable. The seamless coordination and interactive audience made the session both\n        impactful and rewarding.\n\n        As a speaker, I felt valued and supported throughout the process, and it's evident that your\n        team prioritises learner engagement and enrichment. This platform is an excellent avenue for\n        professionals to gain practical knowledge and enhance their expertise.\n\n        I would be happy to collaborate in the future and strongly recommend your platform to\n        anyone seeking structured and impactful learning experiences.\nCA. A. Jatin Christopher\nPartner | JCSS & Associates\nLearning is sporadic because, outside the formal education system, it is unstructured and\n        closely linked to occupational needs.

Over the years, the regulatory framework has undergone significant development, progressively aligning with the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) guidelines.\nIndia's transfer pricing regime now extends to international and specified domestic transactions, necessitating comprehensive documentation and strict adherence to prescribed methodologies for determining arm's length prices. The framework requires a detailed understanding of both legal provisions and practical applications, encompassing a range of topics from fundamental concepts to advanced compliance requirements.\nKey Learnings\nTransfer Pricing Methodologies & Benchmarking Techniques\nComprehensive Overview of TP Compliance Requirements\nDispute Resolution Mechanisms & Risk Mitigation Strategies\nInsights into Recent Judicial Pronouncements\nPractical Checklists for Implementation\nQ&A Sessions\nMasterclass Benefits\nIn-depth learning of Indian Transfer Pricing\nGet Replies to your Queries\nOpportunity to Consult with CA.

This mechanism is essential for the effective implementation of the dual GST structure, which allows both the Centre and the States to levy and collect tax concurrently.\nThe concept aims to streamline tax administration and avoid duplication of efforts. However, it has also raised concerns regarding overlapping jurisdiction and potential conflict between authorities. Judicial interpretations continue to shape the scope and applicability of cross-empowerment, providing clarity on the limits of administrative authority under the GST regime.\nSession Details\nSession 1 | Cross-Empowerment Under GST\u2014Legal Framework & Jurisdictional Challenges\nEvolution of Cross-Empowerment in GST\nStatutory Provisions and Legal Basis\nIntelligence-Based Enforcement Mechanism\nAuthority vs. Procedure\nKey Judicial Rulings on Cross-Empowerment\nJurisdictional Overlaps and Administrative Interplay\nRecent Developments and the Supreme Court\u2019s Perspective\nSpeakers\nHunny Munjal Chartered Accountant He specialises in Indirect Tax advisory and litigation.

However, its practical application often intersects with other legal regimes, including the Companies Act, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), SEBI regulations, and Income Tax laws. These intersections have given rise to interpretational challenges, necessitating judicial clarity and coordinated regulatory practices to ensure consistency and legal harmony.\nSession Details\nSession 1 | Navigating Legal Intersections\u2014IBC and Its Interplay with Companies Act | PMLA | SEBI Act | Income Tax Act\nOverview of the IBC Framework Objectives and key principles of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 Emphasis on time-bound resolution and maximisation of asset value\nObjectives and key principles of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016\nEmphasis on time-bound resolution and maximisation of asset value\nIBC and the Companies Act 2013 \u2013 Points of Convergence and Divergence Winding-up under the Companies Act vs. corporate insolvency resolution under the IBC Jurisdictional transition from High Courts to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Revival and rehabilitation mechanisms under the Companies Act compared to the resolution process under the IBC Section 230 of the Companies Act (Scheme of Compromise or Arrangement) and its relevance during insolvency proceedings\nWinding-up under the Companies Act vs. corporate insolvency resolution under the IBC\nJurisdictional transition from High Courts to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)\nRevival and rehabilitation mechanisms under the Companies Act compared to the resolution process under the IBC\nSection 230 of the Companies Act (Scheme of Compromise or Arrangement) and its relevance during insolvency proceedings\nIBC and PMLA 2002 \u2013 Navigating Legal Conflicts Moratorium under Sections 14 and 33 of the IBC vs. attachment of properties under Section 5 of the PMLA Judicial pronouncements addressing statutory overlaps and conflicts Procedural hurdles in resolving insolvency where assets are attached by the Enforcement Directorate\nMoratorium under Sections 14 and 33 of the IBC vs. attachment of properties under Section 5 of the PMLA\nJudicial pronouncements addressing statutory overlaps and conflicts\nProcedural hurdles in resolving insolvency where assets are attached by the Enforcement Directorate\nIBC and the Income Tax Act 1961 \u2013 Addressing Taxation Issues Treatment of tax dues as operational debt in resolution and liquidation Impact of moratorium on tax assessments, proceedings, and recoveries Availability of post-resolution tax benefits such as carry forward and set-off of losses Limitations on the NCLT's jurisdiction in adjudicating tax-related matters\nTreatment of tax dues as operational debt in resolution and liquidation\nImpact of moratorium on tax assessments, proceedings, and recoveries\nAvailability of post-resolution tax benefits such as carry forward and set-off of losses\nLimitations on the NCLT's jurisdiction in adjudicating tax-related matters\nIBC and SEBI Regulations \u2013 Ensuring Compliance and Market Stability Compliance requirements under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations during CIRP SEBI's role in enabling corporate resolution and protecting investor interests Regulatory oversight to preserve transparency and market integrity during insolvency\nCompliance requirements under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations during CIRP\nSEBI's role in enabling corporate resolution and protecting investor interests\nRegulatory oversight to preserve transparency and market integrity during insolvency\nSpeakers\nAbhinav Mishra Advocate Mr Mishra is a distinguished first-generation advocate and Panel-A Counsel for the Government of India before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

Indian Fund Based\nFAQ 1. What is the Negotiated Dealing System?\nNegotiated Dealing System (NDS) \u2013 Negotiated Dealing System is an electronic platform for facilitating dealing in Government Securities and Money Market Instruments. NDS facilitates electronic submission of bids/application by members for primary issuance of Government Securities by RBI through auction and floatation. It will provide an interface to the Securities Settlement System.\nTrading of Government Securities \u2013 Government securities are traded on Stock exchanges through Negotiated Dealing System using members of BSE/NSE and these trades are required to be reported to the exchange. The bulk of the corporate bonds, being privately placed, were, however, not listed on the stock exchanges and the trend is changing now. Most of the debt securities which are privately placed are now listed either on both the exchanges or on one of the exchange. Two Depositories, NSDL and CDSL maintain records of holding of securities in a dematerialised form. Records of holding of Government securities for wholesale dealers like Banks/Primary Dealers and other financial institutions are maintained by the RBI.\nFAQ 2. What is the road map for listing of debt securities by newly incorporated entity?\nThe major change brought out in the NCS Regulations is that even a newly incorporated entity, other than REIT/InvIT, is allowed to raised funds through the issuance of corporate bonds and tap the listed space of bond market provided it fulfills the following conditions:\nIssuance of debt securities is made only on a private placement basis.\nSuch issuance is made on the Electronic Book Provider (EBP) platform irrespective of the issue size.\nSuch issue may be subscribed by only Qualified Institutional Buyers.\nEarlier, one had to be in existence for a period of at least 3 years to tap the bond market. This will enable Special Purpose Vehicles created for specific infrastructure purposes/NBFCs/listed REITs/listed InvITs and other companies who propose to list debt securities purely on private placement basis but who do not have a three-year existence history, to list their debt securities issued on private placement basis, while, all other requirements under the NCS Regulations and operating stipulations of the EBP mechanism shall continue to apply to such issuers.\n\nFAQ 3. What is the difference between Market Linked Debentures (MLD) and Non-Convertible Debentures (NCD)?\nNon-Convertible Debentures (NCD) is basically fixed-income security where the issuer assures to pay a fixed interest rate on the principal amount to the investor.\nNCD can\u2019t be converted into equity shares of the issuing company, as the name suggests, \u201cnon-convertible\u201d. It has a specified maturity period, after which the investor can redeem the principal amount and the accumulated interest.\nOn the contrary, Market Linked Debentures are structured products linked to the performance of the market index or asset, like commodities, currencies and stocks. MLDs return on investments is not fixed because it is linked to the underlying asset\u2019s performance. So, the returns on MLDs are higher than NCDs when the market performs well but can be negative or zero when the market isn\u2019t performing well.\nFAQ 4.

The proposals were unanimously approved at NFRA\u2019s board meeting held on June 10, 2025, and are now set to be forwarded to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) for final notification. If notified, the revised standards will become effective from April 1, 2026.\nThe meeting, held at NFRA\u2019s New Delhi headquarters, was attended by key stakeholders including NFRA Chairperson, ICAI President, and representatives from the SEBI, RBI, and CAG. While the complete set of amendments spans several standards, the most impactful revisions in Ind AS 109 pertain to:\n(1) derecognition of financial liabilities through electronic payment systems, and\n(2) classification of financial assets under the amortised cost measurement category.\nAs outlined in the Exposure Draft on Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments issued by ICAI, the first amendment, covered under newly inserted paragraph B3.3.8, allows entities to derecognise a financial liability before the settlement date when payment is made through an electronic system, provided specific criteria are met. These include:\n(a) the entity has initiated an irrevocable payment instruction,\n(b) the funds are no longer accessible to the entity, and\n(c) the settlement risk is insignificant.\nThe second amendment clarifies the criteria for determining whether financial assets qualify for amortised cost classification. Through additions such as paragraphs B4.1.8A and B4.1.10A, the Exposure Draft addresses cases where contractual cash flows are linked to contingent events not directly tied to basic lending risks. For instance, if a loan\u2019s interest rate varies based on the borrower\u2019s carbon emission reductions, the entity must assess, qualitatively or quantitatively, whether such a feature results in cash flows that are significantly different from those of a typical lending arrangement. The amendment emphasises that even where such contingent terms exist, the financial asset may still meet the \u201csolely payments of principal and interest\u201d (SPPI) criterion if the resulting cash flows are economically equivalent to those of a basic loan structure under all possible scenarios.\nThese amendments are designed to improve interpretive clarity, reduce inconsistencies in application, and further align Indian standards with global practices under IFRS 9. Once formally notified, entities across sectors, financial and non-financial alike, will need to carefully evaluate their financial instruments to ensure compliance with the revised classification and derecognition requirements under Ind AS 109.\nClick here to access the Exposure Draft\nSource \u2013 The Economic Times CFO\n\nDisclaimer: The content/information published on the website is only for general information of the user and shall not be construed as legal advice.

Trademark\nFAQ 1. What is \u2018trademark\u2019? What are the benefits of trademark to all stakeholders?\nA trademark is a recognisable sign, design or expression which identifies products or services of a particular source from those of others.\nA trademark may be located on a package, a label, a voucher or on the product itself. Trademark symbolises the business reputation.\nTrade mark is valuable property of any business. Some of the well known trademarks are Coca Cola, Pepsi, Tata etc.\nA trademark is intangible property.\nCommon benefits of trademark:\nIt identifies the goods/or services and its origin.\nIt guarantees its unchanged quality.\nIt advertises the goods/services.\nIt creates an image for the goods/services.\nFAQ 2. What is meant by Trademark under the Intellectual Property Rights?\nA trademark is a recognisable sign, design or expression which identifies products or services of a particular source from those of others.\nA trademark may be located on a package, a label, a voucher or on the product itself. Trademark symbolises the business reputation.\nTrade mark is valuable property of any business. Some of the well known trademarks are Coca Cola, Pepsi, Tata etc.\nA trademark is intangible property.\nTrademark [Section 2(zb)] \u2013 Trade mark means a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of others and may include shape of goods, their packaging and combination of colours.\n\nFAQ 3. What are the various natures of trademarks and which trademarks are considered as strong in nature?\nFollowing are the prerequisites for registration of a trademark:\nThe selected mark should be capable of being represented graphically (that is in the paper form).\nIt should be capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of others.\nIt should be used or proposed to be used mark in relation to goods or services for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods or services and some person have the right to use the mark with or without identity of that person.\nAny startup needs to be cautious in selecting its trade name, brands, logos, packaging for products, domain names and any other mark which it proposes to use. You must do a proper due diligence before adopting a trademark. The trademarks can be broadly classified into following five categories:\nGeneric Trademark \u2013 Generic mark means using the name of the product for the product, like \u201cSalt\u201d for salt.\nDescriptive Trademark \u2013 Descriptive marks mean the mark describing the characteristic of the products, like using the mark \u201cFair\u201d for the fairness creams.\nSuggestive Trademarks \u2013 Suggestive marks mean the mark suggesting the characteristic of the products, like \u201cHabitat\u201d for home furnishings products.\nArbitrary Trademarks \u2013 Arbitrary marks means mark which exist in popular vocabulary, but have no logical relationship to the goods or services for which they are used, like \u201cBlackberry\u201d for phones.\nInvented/coined Trademarks \u2013 The invented/coined marks means coining a new word which has no dictionary meaning, like \u201cAdidas\u201d.\nThe strongest marks are easiest to protect are invented or arbitrary marks. The weaker marks are descriptive or suggestive marks which are very hard to protect. The weakest marks are generic marks which can never function as trademarks.\nIndia follows the NICE Classification of Goods & Services for the purpose of registration of trademarks. The NICE Classification groups products into 45 classes (classes 1-34 include goods and classes 35-45 include services). The NICE Classification is recognised in the majority of countries and makes applying for trademarks internationally a streamlined process. Every startup, seeking to trademark a goods or services, has to choose from the appropriate classes, out of the 45 classes.\nWhile adopting any mark, the startup should also keep in mind and ensure that the mark is not being used by any other person in India or abroad, especially if the mark is well-known.\nFAQ 4. What is the Enforcement of Trademark Rights?\nTrademarks can be protected under the Trade Mark Act, 1999 and the common law i.e. under the remedy of passing off. If a person is using a similar mark for similar or related goods or services or is using a well-known mark, the other person can file a suit for violation of his intellectual property i.e. trademark rights irrespective of the fact that the trademark is registered or not.\nRegistration of a trademark is not a prerequisite in order to sustain a civil or criminal action against violation of trademarks in India. The prior adoption and use of the trademark is of utmost importance under trademark laws.\nThe relief which a Court may usually grant in a suit for infringement or passing off includes permanent and interim injunction, damages or account of profits, delivery of the infringing goods for destruction and cost of the legal proceedings. It is pertinent to note that infringement of a trademark is also a cognizable offence and criminal proceedings can also be initiated against the infringers.\n2. Definitions\nFAQ 5. What is Well Known Trademark?\nMark which is similar to well known trademark cannot be registered as trademark under the Trade Mark Act, 1999.\nWell Known Trademark [Section 2(1)(zg)] \u2013 A well known trademark in relation to any goods or services means a mark which has become so to the substantial segment of the public which uses such goods or services such that the use of such mark in relation to other goods or services would be likely to be taken as indicating a connection in the course of trade or rendering of services between those goods or services and a person using the mark in relation to the first-mentioned goods or services.\nExample \u2013 Mercedes Benz may not be known to many persons in India but still it is well known trademark.\nImportant points relating to well known trademark:\nThe Registrar shall take into account factors laid down in Section 11(6) & (7) to determine whether trade Mark is well-known trademark or not.\nWhere a trademark is well known in one part of India it is still regarded as well known trademark under the Act.\nThe well-known trademark need not be used in India, need not be registered in India, even application for registration need not have been filed in India.\nEven if trademark has been registered outside India it can still be considered as well known trademark.\nFAQ 6. \u2018EcoSustain World\u2019 is a multinational corporation with a registered well-known Trade Mark protected across different categories of goods and services and a strong global brand reputation. A new Indian company started using a deceptively similar Trade Mark. Can \u2018EcoSustain World\u2019 protect its trade mark in India?\n(i) Explain with an example the significance of a well-known trade mark as per provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 .\n(ii) Why Registrar will protect \u2018EcoSustain World\u2019?\n\u2018EcoSustain World\u2019 can protect its well-known Trademark in India.\nWell Known Trademark [Section 2(1)( zg )] \u2013 A well known trademark in relation to any goods or services means a mark which has become so to the substantial segment of the public which uses such goods or services such that the use of such mark in relation to other goods or services would be likely to be taken as indicating a connection in the course of trade or rendering of services between those goods or services and a person using the mark in relation to the first-mentioned goods or services.\nExample:\n(1) Mercedes Benz may not be known to many persons in India but still it is well known trademark.\n(2) Google has been registered as a well-known trademark of Alphabet Inc., which thereby means only Alphabet Inc. can register the term \u2018Google\u2019 for any category of goods and services. Even if the service is not related to the Internet industry, no other company but Alphabet Inc. can register \u2018Google\u2019 as its trademark.\nSignificance of a well-known trade mark \u2013 The well-known trademark need not be used in India, need not be registered in India, even application for registration need not have been filed in India.\nEven if trademark has been registered outside India it can still be considered as well known trademark.\nWhy Registrar will protect a well-known trade mark \u2013 A well-known trade mark has been vouchsafed with extraordinary protection and safeguards against passing off and infringement of such trademarks. Well-known trademarks are recognized in India on the basis of their reputation, nationally, internationally and the cross-borders. Unlike other trademarks whose goodwill and reputation is limited to a certain specified geographical area and to a certain range of products, well-known trademarks have its goodwill and reputation protected across the nation and across categories of goods and services. It is law that restricts the Trade Mark Registry to allow and register any mark as a trademark which is deceptively similar to any of the well-known trademark.\n3. Register of Trademark & Conditions for Registration\nFAQ 7. What is Inherently distinctive marks?\nThe Supreme Court in Uniply Industries Ltd. v. Unicorn Plywood Pvt. Ltd. & Others observed that:\nFor inherently distinctive marks ownership is governed by priority of use for such marks. The first user of sale of goods/services is the owner who is senior to others.\nThese marks are given legal protection against infringement immediately upon adoption and use in trade.\nSome courts indicate that even prior sales of goods \u2013 though small in size with the mark \u2013 are sufficient to establish priority, the test being to determine continuous prior user and the volume of sale or the degree of familiarity of the public with the mark.\nTherefore, the proprietorship of the trademark is decided by the date of usage of the mark by a person in business transactions.\nFAQ 8. What are the grounds under which registration of a trademark can be refused?\nAbsolute grounds for refusal of registration [Section 9(1)] \u2013 Following trademarks cannot be registered:\nWhich are devoid of any distinctive character i.e. not capable of distinguishing goods or services of one person from those of another person.\nWhich consist exclusively of marks or indications which may serve in trade to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, values, geographical origin or the time of production of the goods or rendering of the service or other characteristics of the goods or service.\nWhich consist exclusively of marks or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade.\nHowever, if a trade mark has acquired a distinctive character as a result of the use made of it or is a well-known trade mark, its registration shall not be refused.\nIn short, a trademark which has been demonstrated to be distinctive in the marketplace shall be regarded as distinctive in law as well and be registrable.\nMarks which cannot be registered as trademark [Section 9(2)] \u2013 Following marks cannot be registered as trademark:\nWhich is likely to deceive or cause confusion.\u2019\nWhich contains any matter likely to hurt the religious susceptibilities.\nWhich contains scandalous or obscene matter.\nIf its use is prohibited under the Emblems & Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950.\nShape that cannot be registered as trademark [Section 9(3)] \u2013 Following marks cannot be registered as trademark:\nShape of goods which results from the nature of the goods themselves.\nShape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result.\nShape which gives substantial value to the goods.\nRelative grounds for refusal of registration:\n(1) Likely to cause confusion in case of similar goods [Section 11(1)] \u2013 Trademark shall not be registered if there is likelihood of confusion on the part of public because of \u2013\n(a) Its identity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of goods or services covered by the others trademark.\n(b) Its similarity to an earlier trademark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the others trademark.\n(2) Dissimilar goods but trademark already registered [Section 11(2)] \u2013 In case of dissimilar goods, a identical or similar trademark will not be registered if earlier trademark is a well known trademark in India and use of mark proposed to be registered would be unfair or detrimental to proprietor of the well known trademark.\n(3) No registration due to law of passing off or copyright [Section 11(3)] \u2013 A trademark shall not be registered if its use in India is prevented by the law of passing off protection or by law of copyright.\n(4) When trademark can be registered even if similar or identical [Section 11(4)] \u2013 A trademark can be registered if proprietor of earlier trademark gives consent to registration of new mark.\n(5) No refusal unless opposed [Section 11(5)] \u2013 Registration of any trademark shall not be refused unless registration is opposed by proprietor of earlier trademark.\n(6) Section 11(6) lays down the factors that are to be considered by the Registrar to determine whether \u2018a trademark is a well-known trademark or not\u2019.\n(7) Section 11(7) lays down the factors that are to be considered by the Registrar to determine whether \u2018a trademark is known or recognised in a relevant section of the public\u2019.\nFAQ 9. Priya wants to start the trading of incense sticks (agarbattis, dhoops) and perfumeries as M/s Priya Perfumery. She made an application to the Registrar of Trade Marks to register a trade mark by name \u2018RAMAYAN\u2019. State with reasons whether she will succeed in registering such a Trade Mark under the Trade Marks Act, 1999?\nAs per Section 9(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, trademarks cannot be registered which are devoid of any distinctive character i.e. not capable of distinguishing goods or services of one person from those of another person.\nAs per Section 9(2), marks cannot be registered as trademark which contains any matter likely to hurt the religious susceptibilities.\nIn the case of Amritpal Singh v. Lal Babu Priyadarshi , Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) the word RAMAYAN was refused registration on the grounds that \u2013 Firstly, it was not capable of distinguishing the goods of the applicant and Secondly, that it was likely to hurt religious sentiments of a class of society.\nThus, Priya will not succeed in registering such a trademark RAMAYAN under the Trade Marks Act, 1999.\nFAQ 10. What are the absolute grounds for refusal of Registration of trade mark under section 9(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999?\nAbsolute grounds for refusal of registration [Section 9(1)] \u2013 Following trademarks cannot be registered:\nWhich are devoid of any distinctive character i.e. not capable of distinguishing goods or services of one person from those of another person.\nWhich consist exclusively of marks or indications which may serve in trade to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, values, geographical origin or the time of production of the goods or rendering of the service or other characteristics of the goods or service.\nWhich consist exclusively of marks or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade.\nHowever, if a trademark has acquired a distinctive character as a result of the use made of it or is a well-known trade mark, its registration shall not be refused.\nIn short, a trademark which has been demonstrated to be distinctive in the marketplace shall be regarded as distinctive in law as well and be registrable.\n4.

The law of passing off prevents a person from misrepresenting his goods or services as that of another.\nAction | Infringement action can be only in respect of registered trademark. | Passing off action can be taken in respect of registered trademark or unregistered trademark.\nWhat to establish | Definition of \u2018infringement\u2019 is very wide. \u2018Similarity\u2019 and \u2018likely to confuse\u2019 is sufficient to establish infringement of trademark. | While for \u2018passing off\u2019 the mark should be \u2018deceptively similar\u2019.\nBase for action | For infringement action one has to prove violation of his statutory right. | For passing off action one has to show misrepresentation, deceit or bad faith.\n",

However, major differences in appointment process, tenure, shareholder involvement, peer review, and remuneration result in practical confusion and an increased compliance burden. This article compares the existing frameworks, flags areas for improvement, and recommends a harmonized, practical regime for boards and regulators\u2014supporting true \"ease of doing business\" and improved audit quality across the board. Key Terms and Abbreviations \u2022 Statutory Auditor: External auditor appointed under Section 139 , Companies Act, 2013. \u2022 Cost Auditor: Appointed under Section 148 , Companies Act, 2013 for prescribed industries. \u2022 Secretarial Auditor: Peer-reviewed CS in practice, appointed under Section 204 and Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR. \u2022 Internal Auditor: Professional (CA, Cost Accountant, or otherwise), appointed under Section 138 for prescribed class of companies. \u2022 AC: Audit Committee ; SH : Shareholders; CA : Companies Act; LODR : SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 1. Auditor Appointment, Tenure, Remuneration & Governance: Comparative Framework: India's governance regime requires four distinct types of auditor appointments. However, the law prescribes different approaches for each. This lack of uniformity creates compliance risk and boardroom confusion. The table below summarizes the key differences. Auditor Type Legal Reference Tenure / Rotation Appointment Process & Authority Shareholder Approval Required Remuneration Approval / Ratification Peer Review Required Key Restrictions / Disqualifications Statutory Auditor Sec. 139, CA; Reg. 33(1)(d) LODR 5 yrs (individual); 2\u00d75 yrs (firm); 5 yr cooling-off Board recommends; SH appoint at AGM; rotation for listed/large companies Yes (at appointment/reappointment) By SH at appointment; no annual ratification Yes (for listed entities) Sec. 141, ICAI, rotation/cooling-off Cost Auditor Sec. 148, CA Not fixed by law; annual by practice Board appoints (on AC recommendation's if required.), SH ratify remuneration No (except remuneration) Board fixes, annual SH ratification required No Not statutory auditor of same company; must comply with cost standards Secretarial Auditor Sec. 204, CA; Reg. 24A LODR; SEBI Circular Dec 2024 5 yrs (individual); 2\u00d75 yrs (firm); 5 yr cooling-off Board recommends; SH approve (where required); Peer-reviewed CS Yes (at appointment/rotation) Board/SH at appointment; no annual ratification Yes (for listed entities) SEBI/ICSI/LODR disqualifications; peer review; prohibited services Internal Auditor Sec. 138, CA Not fixed by law; annual by practice Board or AC appoints; can be CA/Cost Accountant/other professional No Board fixes; no SH ratification No None specified (except eligibility for profession) Legend: \u2022 SH = Shareholder; AC = Audit Committee; CA = Companies Act. For a step-by-step, ready-to-use visual guide to the auditor appointment process for each auditor type, see Annexure \u2013 I : Sample Process Flow for Auditor Appointment at the end of this article and FAQ has been given as Annexure \u2013 II. 2. Key Gaps and Recommendations: Despite regulatory progress, several critical gaps persist across auditor types. The following table provides targeted, actionable recommendations for boards and regulators. Gap Area Recommendation Intended Outcome Tenure/Rotation Fix minimum term/rotation (e.g., 3\u20135 yrs) for cost & internal\nauditors Continuity, independence, board focus Remuneration Ratification Standardize: Board/SH approval for all at appointment; annual only if material\nchange Reduces compliance, increases clarity Peer Review Mandate for cost auditor and internal auditor (if\noutsourced/large company /critical business segment) Raise quality, market trust Appointment Process Uniform process: AC/Board review, SH/Board approval, standard\ndisclosure Transparency, risk reduction Policy Review Annual board review of all auditor appointments, independence,\nrotation Keeps policy current and effective 3. Boardroom Case Studies: Gaps & Best Practices Case Study 1 \u2013 Compliance Miss (Cost Auditor): XYZ Ltd. missed timely reappointment of its cost auditor, assuming last year's approval sufficed. Regulator flagged the lapse, resulting in a penalty and reputational risk. Root cause: lack of uniform, automated tracking and unclear tenure policy for cost/internal auditors. Model Board Response: \u2022 Integrate auditor tenure tracking across all auditor types. \u2022 Automate renewal/ratification alerts. \u2022 Ensure annual board/AC policy review of all auditor appointments. Case Study 2 \u2013 Uniform Policy Success: ABC Ltd. implemented a board-approved, unified auditor appointment policy. Every auditor's eligibility, tenure, remuneration, and independence are tracked in a central system, with annual board oversight. The company passed a surprise regulatory inspection with zero findings. Lessons: \u2022 Harmonized policies and integrated systems prevent lapses. \u2022 Uniform standards across auditor types build trust with regulators and investors. 4. Model Harmonized Framework for Auditor Appointments: In light of the complex and often fragmented regulatory environment surrounding auditor appointments in India, there is a pressing need for a streamlined and harmonized framework. A model approach can help boards, audit committees, and regulators ensure consistency, transparency, and robust governance\u2014regardless of auditor type. This section proposes a unified framework that integrates best practices and statutory requirements for statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal auditors. Aspect Current (Fragmented) Model Framework (Suggested) Tenure 5 yrs for statutory/secretarial; 1 yr or undefined for others 3\u20135 yrs minimum, mandatory rotation for all auditors Appointment AC/Board/SH combinations vary by auditor AC/Board review for all, SH approval at appointment/reappointment Remuneration Only cost auditor needs annual ratification Fixed at appointment for all; annual SH ratification if changed materially Peer Review Statutory/secretarial auditors (listed) only Peer review for all in large/public companies Disclosure Appointment/remuneration in minutes or filings as required Standardized, uniform disclosure in board documents and filings Policy Review Not universal Annual board policy review for all auditor types 5. Practical Boardroom Checklist: Auditor Appointment Oversight \u2022 Are all auditor appointments, tenures, and remuneration reviewed and documented by the Audit Committee and Board? \u2022 Is there an automated system tracking reappointments, ratification deadlines, and peer review status for all auditors? \u2022 Is the same rigor applied to cost and internal auditor appointments as for statutory and secretarial auditors? \u2022 Are all regulatory filings (ADT-1, resolutions, etc.) completed timely for each appointment? \u2022 Has the board reviewed the policy and updated it for new regulations this year? 6. Boardroom and Regulatory Action Points \u2022 Unify Policies : Approve a board policy covering all auditor types\u2014statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal. \u2022 Automate Compliance : Use digital tools to track appointment, tenure, and peer review status. \u2022 Standardize Disclosure : Require uniform appointment and remuneration disclosure in all board and shareholder documentation. \u2022 Regular Policy Review : Mandate annual review of auditor appointment/rotation/remuneration policy at board and AC meetings. \u2022 Engage with Regulators : Provide feedback on harmonizing tenure, remuneration, and peer review rules to support ease of doing business. 7. Suggested Regulatory Language for Uniformity: For all company auditors (statutory, cost, secretarial and internal), appointment, tenure, remuneration, and independence/peer review requirements should be standardized: Board/AC review, fixed tenure with rotation, appointment/remuneration at SH or board level, and peer review certification (where applicable), to streamline compliance and enhance governance. 8. Conclusion: A company's auditor appointment and oversight regime is central to its governance framework and investor confidence. Lack of uniformity in law for cost and internal auditors compared to statutory and secretarial auditors deserves urgent reform. Rationalizing tenure, appointment, remuneration, and peer review standards across all auditors will elevate both governance and audit quality, supporting India's \"ease of doing business\" vision.

Who appoints the Statutory Auditor, and what is the term? Answer: The statutory auditor is appointed by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) , based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee (where applicable, as per Section 177 ) and the Board of Directors . This is mandated under Section 139 of the Companies Act, 2013. \u2022 Term of Appointment: \u25cb For an individual auditor: The term is 5 consecutive years . \u25cb For an audit firm: The term is two consecutive terms of 5 years each (i.e., a total of 10 years). \u25cb After completing the maximum term, there is a mandatory cooling-off period of 5 years before the same auditor/audit firm (or a firm with common partners) can be reappointed in the same company ( Section 139(2) and related Rules). \u2022 Applicability: \u25cb The rotation and cooling-off requirements are mandatory for listed companies and prescribed classes of public companies (as specified under Rule 5 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014). 2. Is shareholder ratification of auditor remuneration required for all auditor types? Answer: No. Annual shareholder ratification of remuneration is only legally mandated for cost auditors . The requirements for different auditor types are as follows: \u2022 Statutory Auditor [Section 142]: Remuneration is fixed by the shareholders at the time of appointment or reappointment in the AGM, in accordance with Section 142(1) of the Companies Act, 2013. Annual ratification is not required unless there is a specific change in remuneration or if stipulated by shareholders at the time of appointment. \u2022 Cost Auditor : Remuneration is fixed by the Board on the recommendation of the Audit Committee (where applicable), but annual ratification by shareholders is compulsory as per Section 148(3) of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule 14 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014. \u2022 Secretarial Auditor: Remuneration is approved by the Board or shareholders (where required) at the time of appointment, as per Section 204 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR Regulations. Annual ratification is not required unless stipulated in the resolution. \u2022 Internal Auditor : Remuneration is approved by the Board of Directors or Audit Committee (as per company policy), with no requirement for shareholder ratification under Section 138 of the Companies Act, 2013 and related rules. 3. What is the process for appointing a Cost Auditor? Answer: The appointment of a Cost Auditor is governed by Section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule 14 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 . Step-by-Step Process: 1. Recommendation by Audit Committee (if applicable): \u25cb If the company is required to have an Audit Committee (under Section 177 of the Companies Act, 2013), the Audit Committee recommends the appointment and remuneration of the cost auditor to the Board [ Reference: Rule 14(a) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014] 2. Appointment by Board: \u25cb The Board of Directors appoints an individual cost accountant or a firm of cost accountants in practice as the cost auditor [ Reference: Section 148(3) of the Companies Act, 2013; Rule 14(a)/(b)] 3. Remuneration Approval: \u25cb The remuneration recommended by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board must be ratified by shareholders at the subsequent general meeting, every financial year [Reference: Section 148(3) of the Companies Act, 2013; Rule 14(a)(ii)/(b)] 4. Filing with Registrar of Companies (ROC): \u25cb The company must file a notice of appointment in Form CRA-2 with the ROC within 30 days of Board appointment or as prescribed [ Reference: Rule 6(2) of the Companies (Cost Records and Audit) Rules, 2014] 5. Are there peer review requirements for all types of auditors? Answer: No, peer review is not required for all types of auditors. The legal requirements are as follows: (a) Statutory Auditors (Listed Entities) \u2013 Peer Review is mandatory \u2022 Reference: Regulation 33(1)(d) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 : \"The listed entity shall ensure that the limited review or audit reports submitted to the stock exchange(s) are given only by an auditor who has subjected himself/herself to the peer review process of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and holds a valid certificate issued by the Peer Review Board of ICAI.\" (b) Secretarial Auditors (Listed Entities) - Peer Review is mandatory \u2022 Reference: Regulation 24A(1A) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) and SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-2/CIR/P/2024/185 dated December 31, 2024 : \"A person shall be eligible for appointment as a Secretarial Auditor of the listed entity only if such person is a Peer Reviewed Company Secretary and has not incurred any of the disqualifications as specified by the Board.\" (c) Cost Auditors \u2013 Peer review is not mandatory \u2022 No legal requirement for peer review as per Section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 or the Companies (Cost Records and Audit) Rules, 2014. \u2022 Best Practice: Peer review is recommended for large/listed companies but is not mandated by law. (d) Internal Auditors \u2013 peer review is not mandatory \u2022 No legal requirement for peer review as per Section 138 of the Companies Act, 2013 or the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014. \u2022 Companies are free to appoint internal or external qualified professional for its internal audit. 6. What is the minimum tenure for internal and cost auditors? Answer: There is no minimum statutory tenure prescribed for internal and cost auditors. By industry practice, they are generally appointed for one financial year at a time and reappointed annually unless the Board decides otherwise. 7. What is the \"cooling-off\" period for auditors, and who does it apply to? Answer: After serving the maximum term, statutory and secretarial auditors (for listed entities) are subject to a 5-year cooling-off period before they can be reappointed in the same company. This ensures independence. There is no such requirement for cost or internal auditors. 8. Can the same individual or firm act as both statutory and cost auditor? Answer: No. The law expressly prohibits the statutory auditor of a company from acting as its cost auditor to ensure independence of audit. 9. What disclosures are required upon appointment of an auditor? Answer: \u2022 Statutory Auditor: Upon appointment (or reappointment) of the statutory auditor under Section 139 of the Companies Act, 2013, the company is required to file Form ADT-1 with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) within 15 days of the meeting in which the auditor is appointed. \u2022 Cost Auditor : For appointment of a cost auditor under Section 148, the company must file Form CRA-2 with the RoC within 30 days of the Board meeting in which the cost auditor is appointed, or within 180 days of the commencement of the financial year, whichever is earlier. \u2022 Secretarial Auditor : The appointment of a secretarial auditor (Section 204, Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR) is made by Board resolution. While there is no specific e-form prescribed under the Companies Act for appointment of secretarial auditor, if the appointment constitutes a resolution under Section 179(3) (i.e., for powers delegated to the Board), the company may file Form MGT-14 with the RoC for such board resolution, though this is not universally practiced and is sometimes subject to legal interpretation. \u2022 Internal Auditor : Similarly, appointment of an internal auditor (Section 138) is made by the Board and, if the appointment is by a board resolution covered under Section 179(3), Form MGT-14 may be filed for the board resolution, though it is not mandatory under law for all companies. Best Practice: For all auditor appointments, companies should maintain clear board and/or shareholder resolution records, document eligibility, independence, and credentials, and ensure compliance with disclosure requirements of SEBI LODR (where applicable). 10. Who approves the appointment of internal auditors? Answer: The Board of Directors or the Audit Committee appoints the internal auditor, depending on the company's structure and applicable regulations. No shareholder approval is required. 11. How can boards strengthen auditor appointment and oversight processes? Answer: Boards should establish clear internal policies for the selection, tenure, rotation, and independence of all auditors, conduct annual reviews, and ensure disclosures and processes comply with the Companies Act, SEBI LODR, and industry best practices. 12. If the cost auditor's remuneration is not ratified by shareholders, is the appointment valid? Answer: As per Section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule 14 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014, annual shareholder ratification of the cost auditor's remuneration is mandatory. If the remuneration is not ratified, the company will be in non-compliance, which may result in regulatory action or objections by the Registrar of Companies. Practical Viewpoint: Some practitioners have suggested operational solutions to reduce the annual compliance burden, such as: \u2022 Seeking shareholder approval for a maximum remuneration cap for a period (e.g., not exceeding ?20 lakhs per annum for up to five years), with the Board/Audit Committee authorized to fix remuneration within this limit. \u2022 Approving a multi-year remuneration structure upfront (e.g., for five years, with a predetermined annual increment). While these approaches may reduce procedural repetition and are in the spirit of \"ease of doing business,\" they are not expressly recognized in the present statutory framework. Until the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) or relevant regulatory authority issues specific clarification or relaxes the current rules, it is advisable to continue with annual shareholder ratification of cost auditor remuneration to ensure strict compliance. Recommendation: For companies wishing to implement a forward-looking approach, it is prudent to formally represent this to the regulator or seek legal opinion, and to clearly disclose the basis for the approach in the board's proposal and shareholder resolution. 13. What happens if the statutory auditor's peer review certificate expires during the term? Answer: If a statutory auditor's peer review certificate lapses, they become ineligible to issue limited review or audit reports for listed companies. The board must ensure timely renewal and may need to take corrective steps if non-compliance is discovered (including considering replacement). 14. Can the internal auditor be an employee of the company? Answer: Yes. Internal auditors can be either employees or external professionals (CA, Cost Accountant, or others). However, independence and objectivity should be ensured, especially in large or listed companies 15. If a statutory auditor or secretarial auditor is found to have a disqualification after appointment, what should the company do? Answer: If any disqualification arises post-appointment, the auditor must vacate their position immediately. The board should promptly fill the vacancy (as per statutory timelines) and disclose the circumstances in board reports and filings. 16. How should the board respond if the Audit Committee and Board disagree on the appointment of an auditor? Answer: If there is a disagreement, the Board must record its reasons and, if not accepting the Audit Committee's recommendation, send its own recommendation to shareholders, explaining both perspectives for a transparent decision at the AGM. 17. What governance risk arises if an auditor's independence is compromised (e.g., business relationships, relatives as directors)? Answer: Compromised independence can result in regulatory penalties, voided audits, and loss of stakeholder trust. The board must implement strong pre-appointment vetting, annual independence declarations, and ongoing monitoring. 18. Can the same audit firm act as statutory auditor for more than one company within the same group? Answer: Yes, subject to the aggregate audit ceiling and rotation/cooling-off requirements under the Companies Act and SEBI LODR. However, boards should review for potential conflicts of interest or independence issues within the group. 19. Is it mandatory to rotate audit partners within an audit firm? Answer: Yes, for listed and prescribed public companies, rotation of audit partners within the firm is mandated by law and ICAI guidelines, even if the audit firm itself continues. 20. What steps should the Board take if the statutory auditor resigns mid-term? Answer: The Board (or C&AG for government companies) must fill the casual vacancy within 30 days, and if due to resignation, obtain shareholder approval at a general meeting within three months. 21. What is best practice if a cost audit report contains significant qualifications? Answer: The Board should review and respond to every qualification or adverse remark, provide explanations and record the same in board's minutes. The same shall be suitably reported  in the Board's report, and implement corrective action plans to address underlying process or control deficiencies. 22. If a company has multiple business units, can it appoint different auditors for each unit? Answer: Generally, a single statutory auditor is appointed for the company as a whole. For cost and internal audits, different auditors may be appointed for different units or divisions, provided oversight, coordination, and reporting are robust. 23. How should the Board document and disclose auditor appointments for transparency? Answer: All appointments (and changes) should be minuted, disclosed in Board and AGM resolutions, notified to the ROC as required, and detailed in the corporate governance section of the annual report. 24. Can cost auditor also provide other services to the company? Answer: Only if such services do not impair independence or are not expressly prohibited by law or professional standards. The Board should periodically review auditor services to prevent conflicts of interest. 25. What should trigger a board-level review of auditor independence and performance? Answer: Triggers include: regulatory notices, NFRA/ICAI observations, recurring audit qualifications, stakeholder concerns, changes in audit team, or material corporate actions (M&A, restructuring). 26. How often should Board policy on auditor appointment and oversight be reviewed? Answer: At least annually, and whenever there are changes in law, SEBI or NFRA guidelines, or following any significant audit-related incident.

This section proposes a unified framework that integrates best practices and statutory requirements for statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal auditors.\nAspect\nCurrent (Fragmented)\nModel Framework (Suggested)\nTenure\n5 yrs for statutory/secretarial; 1 yr or undefined for others\n3\u20135 yrs minimum, mandatory rotation for all auditors\nAppointment\nAC/Board/SH combinations vary by auditor\nAC/Board review for all, SH approval at appointment/reappointment\nRemuneration\nOnly cost auditor needs annual ratification\nFixed at appointment for all; annual SH ratification if changed materially\nPeer Review\nStatutory/secretarial auditors (listed) only\nPeer review for all in large/public companies\nDisclosure\nAppointment/remuneration in minutes or filings as required\nStandardized, uniform disclosure in board documents and filings\nPolicy Review\nNot universal\nAnnual board policy review for all auditor types\n5.\n\nPractical Boardroom Checklist: Auditor Appointment Oversight\n\u2022\n\nAre all auditor appointments, tenures, and remuneration reviewed and documented by the Audit Committee and Board?\n\u2022\n\nIs there an automated system tracking reappointments, ratification deadlines, and peer review status for all auditors?\n\u2022\n\nIs the same rigor applied to cost and internal auditor appointments as for statutory and secretarial auditors?\n\u2022\n\nAre all regulatory filings (ADT-1, resolutions, etc.) completed timely for each appointment?\n\u2022\n\nHas the board reviewed the policy and updated it for new regulations this year?\n6.\n\nBoardroom and Regulatory Action Points\n\u2022\n\nUnify Policies : Approve a board policy covering all auditor types\u2014statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal.\n\u2022\n\nAutomate Compliance : Use digital tools to track appointment, tenure, and peer review status.\n\u2022\n\nStandardize Disclosure : Require uniform appointment and remuneration disclosure in all board and shareholder documentation.\n\u2022\n\nRegular Policy Review : Mandate annual review of auditor appointment/rotation/remuneration policy at board and AC meetings.\n\u2022\n\nEngage with Regulators : Provide feedback on harmonizing tenure, remuneration, and peer review rules to support ease of doing business.\n7.\n\nSuggested Regulatory Language for Uniformity: For all company auditors (statutory, cost, secretarial and internal), appointment, tenure, remuneration, and independence/peer review requirements should be standardized: Board/AC review, fixed tenure with rotation, appointment/remuneration at SH or board level, and peer review certification (where applicable), to streamline compliance and enhance governance.\n8.\n\nConclusion: A company's auditor appointment and oversight regime is central to its governance framework and investor confidence. Lack of uniformity in law for cost and internal auditors compared to statutory and secretarial auditors deserves urgent reform. Rationalizing tenure, appointment, remuneration, and peer review standards across all auditors will elevate both governance and audit quality, supporting India's \"ease of doing business\" vision.\nStep\nStatutory Auditor\nCost Auditor\nSecretarial Auditor\nInternal Auditor\nEligibility Check\nBoard/AC reviews, ICAI/peer review certificate required\nBoard/AC reviews; eligibility under CA, cost standards\nBoard/AC reviews, Peer-reviewed CS required\nBoard/AC reviews, CA/Cost Accountant/Other\nRecommendation\nAC to Board to SH\nAC (if required) to Board\nBoard/AC to SH (as required)\nAC/Board\nAppointment\nSH at AGM\nBoard (remuneration: SH ratify)\nBoard/SH (as required)\nBoard/AC\nTenure/Rotation\n5 yrs (individual)/2\u00d75 (firm)\n1 yr by practice\n5 yrs (individual)/2\u00d75 (firm)\nAnnual by practice\nRemuneration\nSH at appointment\nBoard, SH ratify annually\nBoard/SH at appointment\nBoard\nDisclosure\nADT-1, minutes\nResolution, minutes\nResolution, minutes\nMinutes\n1.\n\nWho appoints the Statutory Auditor, and what is the term?\n\n\nAnswer: The statutory auditor is appointed by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) , based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee (where applicable, as per Section 177 ) and the Board of Directors . This is mandated under Section 139 of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\u2022\n\nTerm of Appointment:\n\u25cb\n\nFor an individual auditor: The term is 5 consecutive years .\n\u25cb\n\nFor an audit firm: The term is two consecutive terms of 5 years each (i.e., a total of 10 years).\n\u25cb\n\nAfter completing the maximum term, there is a mandatory cooling-off period of 5 years before the same auditor/audit firm (or a firm with common partners) can be reappointed in the same company ( Section 139(2) and related Rules).\n\u2022\n\nApplicability:\n\u25cb\n\nThe rotation and cooling-off requirements are mandatory for listed companies and prescribed classes of public companies (as specified under Rule 5 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014).\n2.\n\nIs shareholder ratification of auditor remuneration required for all auditor types?\n\n\nAnswer: No. Annual shareholder ratification of remuneration is only legally mandated for cost auditors . The requirements for different auditor types are as follows:\n\u2022\n\nStatutory Auditor [Section 142]: Remuneration is fixed by the shareholders at the time of appointment or reappointment in the AGM, in accordance with Section 142(1) of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n\nAnnual ratification is not required unless there is a specific change in remuneration or if stipulated by shareholders at the time of appointment.\n\u2022\n\nCost Auditor : Remuneration is fixed by the Board on the recommendation of the Audit Committee (where applicable), but annual ratification by shareholders is compulsory as per Section 148(3) of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule 14 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014.\n\u2022\n\nSecretarial Auditor: Remuneration is approved by the Board or shareholders (where required) at the time of appointment, as per Section 204 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR Regulations.\n\n\nAnnual ratification is not required unless stipulated in the resolution.\n\u2022\n\nInternal Auditor : Remuneration is approved by the Board of Directors or Audit Committee (as per company policy), with no requirement for shareholder ratification under Section 138 of the Companies Act, 2013 and related rules.\n3.\n\nWhat is the process for appointing a Cost Auditor?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nThe appointment of a Cost Auditor is governed by Section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule 14 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 .\n1.\n\nRecommendation by Audit Committee (if applicable):\n\u25cb\n\nIf the company is required to have an Audit Committee (under Section 177 of the Companies Act, 2013), the Audit Committee recommends the appointment and remuneration of the cost auditor to the Board [ Reference: Rule 14(a) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014]\n2.\n\nAppointment by Board:\n\u25cb\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints an individual cost accountant or a firm of cost accountants in practice as the cost auditor [ Reference: Section 148(3) of the Companies Act, 2013; Rule 14(a)/(b)]\n3.\n\nRemuneration Approval:\n\u25cb\n\nThe remuneration recommended by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board must be ratified by shareholders at the subsequent general meeting, every financial year [Reference: Section 148(3) of the Companies Act, 2013; Rule 14(a)(ii)/(b)]\n4.\n\nFiling with Registrar of Companies (ROC):\n\u25cb\n\nThe company must file a notice of appointment in Form CRA-2 with the ROC within 30 days of Board appointment or as prescribed [ Reference: Rule 6(2) of the Companies (Cost Records and Audit) Rules, 2014]\n5.\n\nAre there peer review requirements for all types of auditors?\n\n\nAnswer: No, peer review is not required for all types of auditors. The legal requirements are as follows:\n\n\n(a) Statutory Auditors (Listed Entities) \u2013 Peer Review is mandatory\n\u2022\n\nReference: Regulation 33(1)(d) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 :\n\n\n\"The listed entity shall ensure that the limited review or audit reports submitted to the stock exchange(s) are given only by an auditor who has subjected himself/herself to the peer review process of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and holds a valid certificate issued by the Peer Review Board of ICAI.\"\n\n\n(b) Secretarial Auditors (Listed Entities) - Peer Review is mandatory\n\u2022\n\nReference: Regulation 24A(1A) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) and SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-2/CIR/P/2024/185 dated December 31, 2024 :\n\n\n\"A person shall be eligible for appointment as a Secretarial Auditor of the listed entity only if such person is a Peer Reviewed Company Secretary and has not incurred any of the disqualifications as specified by the Board.\"\n\n\n(c) Cost Auditors \u2013 Peer review is not mandatory\n\u2022\n\nNo legal requirement for peer review as per Section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 or the Companies (Cost Records and Audit) Rules, 2014.\n\u2022\n\nBest Practice: Peer review is recommended for large/listed companies but is not mandated by law.\n\n\n(d) Internal Auditors \u2013 peer review is not mandatory\n\u2022\n\nNo legal requirement for peer review as per Section 138 of the Companies Act, 2013 or the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014.\n\u2022\n\nCompanies are free to appoint internal or external qualified professional for its internal audit.\n6.\n\nWhat is the minimum tenure for internal and cost auditors?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nThere is no minimum statutory tenure prescribed for internal and cost auditors. By industry practice, they are generally appointed for one financial year at a time and reappointed annually unless the Board decides otherwise.\n7.\n\nWhat is the \"cooling-off\" period for auditors, and who does it apply to?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nAfter serving the maximum term, statutory and secretarial auditors (for listed entities) are subject to a 5-year cooling-off period before they can be reappointed in the same company. This ensures independence. There is no such requirement for cost or internal auditors.\n8.\n\nCan the same individual or firm act as both statutory and cost auditor?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nNo. The law expressly prohibits the statutory auditor of a company from acting as its cost auditor to ensure independence of audit.\n9.\n\nWhat disclosures are required upon appointment of an auditor?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\u2022\n\nStatutory Auditor: Upon appointment (or reappointment) of the statutory auditor under Section 139 of the Companies Act, 2013, the company is required to file Form ADT-1 with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) within 15 days of the meeting in which the auditor is appointed.\n\u2022\n\nCost Auditor : For appointment of a cost auditor under Section 148, the company must file Form CRA-2 with the RoC within 30 days of the Board meeting in which the cost auditor is appointed, or within 180 days of the commencement of the financial year, whichever is earlier.\n\u2022\n\nSecretarial Auditor : The appointment of a secretarial auditor (Section 204, Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR) is made by Board resolution. While there is no specific e-form prescribed under the Companies Act for appointment of secretarial auditor, if the appointment constitutes a resolution under Section 179(3) (i.e., for powers delegated to the Board), the company may file Form MGT-14 with the RoC for such board resolution, though this is not universally practiced and is sometimes subject to legal interpretation.\n\u2022\n\nInternal Auditor : Similarly, appointment of an internal auditor (Section 138) is made by the Board and, if the appointment is by a board resolution covered under Section 179(3), Form MGT-14 may be filed for the board resolution, though it is not mandatory under law for all companies.\n\n\nBest Practice: For all auditor appointments, companies should maintain clear board and/or shareholder resolution records, document eligibility, independence, and credentials, and ensure compliance with disclosure requirements of SEBI LODR (where applicable).\n10.\n\nWho approves the appointment of internal auditors?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nThe Board of Directors or the Audit Committee appoints the internal auditor, depending on the company's structure and applicable regulations. No shareholder approval is required.\n11.\n\nHow can boards strengthen auditor appointment and oversight processes?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nBoards should establish clear internal policies for the selection, tenure, rotation, and independence of all auditors, conduct annual reviews, and ensure disclosures and processes comply with the Companies Act, SEBI LODR, and industry best practices.\n12.\n\nIf the cost auditor's remuneration is not ratified by shareholders, is the appointment valid?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nAs per Section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule 14 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014, annual shareholder ratification of the cost auditor's remuneration is mandatory. If the remuneration is not ratified, the company will be in non-compliance, which may result in regulatory action or objections by the Registrar of Companies.\n\n\nPractical Viewpoint: Some practitioners have suggested operational solutions to reduce the annual compliance burden, such as:\n\u2022\n\nSeeking shareholder approval for a maximum remuneration cap for a period (e.g., not exceeding ?20 lakhs per annum for up to five years), with the Board/Audit Committee authorized to fix remuneration within this limit.\n\u2022\n\nApproving a multi-year remuneration structure upfront (e.g., for five years, with a predetermined annual increment).\n\n\nWhile these approaches may reduce procedural repetition and are in the spirit of \"ease of doing business,\" they are not expressly recognized in the present statutory framework. Until the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) or relevant regulatory authority issues specific clarification or relaxes the current rules, it is advisable to continue with annual shareholder ratification of cost auditor remuneration to ensure strict compliance.\n\n\nRecommendation: For companies wishing to implement a forward-looking approach, it is prudent to formally represent this to the regulator or seek legal opinion, and to clearly disclose the basis for the approach in the board's proposal and shareholder resolution.\n13.\n\nWhat happens if the statutory auditor's peer review certificate expires during the term?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nIf a statutory auditor's peer review certificate lapses, they become ineligible to issue limited review or audit reports for listed companies. The board must ensure timely renewal and may need to take corrective steps if non-compliance is discovered (including considering replacement).\n14.\n\nCan the internal auditor be an employee of the company?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nYes. Internal auditors can be either employees or external professionals (CA, Cost Accountant, or others). However, independence and objectivity should be ensured, especially in large or listed companies\n15.\n\nIf a statutory auditor or secretarial auditor is found to have a disqualification after appointment, what should the company do?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nIf any disqualification arises post-appointment, the auditor must vacate their position immediately. The board should promptly fill the vacancy (as per statutory timelines) and disclose the circumstances in board reports and filings.\n16.\n\nHow should the board respond if the Audit Committee and Board disagree on the appointment of an auditor?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nIf there is a disagreement, the Board must record its reasons and, if not accepting the Audit Committee's recommendation, send its own recommendation to shareholders, explaining both perspectives for a transparent decision at the AGM.\n17.\n\nWhat governance risk arises if an auditor's independence is compromised (e.g., business relationships, relatives as directors)?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nCompromised independence can result in regulatory penalties, voided audits, and loss of stakeholder trust. The board must implement strong pre-appointment vetting, annual independence declarations, and ongoing monitoring.\n18.\n\nCan the same audit firm act as statutory auditor for more than one company within the same group?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nYes, subject to the aggregate audit ceiling and rotation/cooling-off requirements under the Companies Act and SEBI LODR. However, boards should review for potential conflicts of interest or independence issues within the group.\n19.\n\nIs it mandatory to rotate audit partners within an audit firm?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nYes, for listed and prescribed public companies, rotation of audit partners within the firm is mandated by law and ICAI guidelines, even if the audit firm itself continues.\n20.\n\nWhat steps should the Board take if the statutory auditor resigns mid-term?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nThe Board (or C&AG for government companies) must fill the casual vacancy within 30 days, and if due to resignation, obtain shareholder approval at a general meeting within three months.\n21.\n\nWhat is best practice if a cost audit report contains significant qualifications?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nThe Board should review and respond to every qualification or adverse remark, provide explanations and record the same in board's minutes. The same shall be suitably reported  in the Board's report, and implement corrective action plans to address underlying process or control deficiencies.\n22.\n\nIf a company has multiple business units, can it appoint different auditors for each unit?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nGenerally, a single statutory auditor is appointed for the company as a whole. For cost and internal audits, different auditors may be appointed for different units or divisions, provided oversight, coordination, and reporting are robust.\n23.\n\nHow should the Board document and disclose auditor appointments for transparency?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nAll appointments (and changes) should be minuted, disclosed in Board and AGM resolutions, notified to the ROC as required, and detailed in the corporate governance section of the annual report.\n24.\n\nCan cost auditor also provide other services to the company?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nOnly if such services do not impair independence or are not expressly prohibited by law or professional standards. The Board should periodically review auditor services to prevent conflicts of interest.\n25.\n\nWhat should trigger a board-level review of auditor independence and performance?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nTriggers include: regulatory notices, NFRA/ICAI observations, recurring audit qualifications, stakeholder concerns, changes in audit team, or material corporate actions (M&A, restructuring).\n26.\n\nHow often should Board policy on auditor appointment and oversight be reviewed?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nAt least annually, and whenever there are changes in law, SEBI or NFRA guidelines, or following any significant audit-related incident.\nCopy(ctrl+C)\nMy Notes Add Note View All Notes\nAdd Note\nView All Notes\nBookmark\nConsequences of not affixing the signboard at the

appointment of four key types of auditors\u2014statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal\u2014for larger companies. However, major differences in appointment process, tenure, shareholder involvement, peer review, and remuneration result in practical confusion and an increased compliance burden. This article compares the existing frameworks, flags areas for improvement, and recommends a harmonized, practical regime for boards and regulators\u2014supporting true \"ease of doing business\" and improved audit quality across the board.Key Terms and Abbreviations\u2022Statutory Auditor:External auditor appointed under Section139, Companies Act, 2013.\u2022Cost Auditor:Appointed under Section148, Companies Act, 2013 for prescribed industries.\u2022Secretarial Auditor:Peer-reviewed CS in practice, appointed under Section204and Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR.\u2022Internal Auditor:Professional (CA, Cost Accountant, or otherwise), appointed under Section138for prescribed class of companies.\u2022AC:Audit Committee; SH: Shareholders;CA: Companies Act;LODR: SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.1.Auditor Appointment, Tenure, Remuneration & Governance: Comparative Framework:India's governance regime requires four distinct types of auditor appointments. However, the law prescribes different approaches for each. This lack of uniformity creates compliance risk and boardroom confusion.

A model approach can help boards, audit committees, and regulators ensure consistency, transparency, and robust governance\u2014regardless of auditor type. This section proposes a unified framework that integrates best practices and statutory requirements for statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal auditors.AspectCurrent (Fragmented)Model Framework (Suggested)Tenure5 yrs for statutory/secretarial; 1 yr or undefined for others3\u20135 yrs minimum, mandatory rotation for all auditorsAppointmentAC/Board/SH combinations vary by auditorAC/Board review for all, SH approval at appointment/reappointmentRemunerationOnly cost auditor needs annual ratificationFixed at appointment for all; annual SH ratification if changed materiallyPeer ReviewStatutory/secretarial auditors (listed) onlyPeer review for all in large/public companiesDisclosureAppointment/remuneration in minutes or filings as requiredStandardized, uniform disclosure in board documents and filingsPolicy ReviewNot universalAnnual board policy review for all auditor types5.Practical Boardroom Checklist: Auditor Appointment Oversight\u2022Are all auditor appointments, tenures, and remuneration reviewed and documented by the Audit Committee and Board?\u2022Is there an automated system tracking reappointments, ratification deadlines, and peer review status for all auditors?\u2022Is the same rigor applied to cost and internal auditor appointments as for statutory and secretarial auditors?\u2022Are all regulatory filings (ADT-1, resolutions, etc.) completed timely for each appointment?\u2022Has the board reviewed the policy and updated it for new regulations this year?6.Boardroom and Regulatory Action Points\u2022Unify Policies: Approve a board policy covering all auditor types\u2014statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal.\u2022Automate Compliance: Use digital tools to track appointment, tenure, and peer review status.\u2022Standardize Disclosure: Require uniform appointment and remuneration disclosure in all board and shareholder documentation.\u2022Regular Policy Review: Mandate annual review of auditor appointment/rotation/remuneration policy at board and AC meetings.\u2022Engage with Regulators: Provide feedback on harmonizing tenure, remuneration, and peer review rules to support ease of doing business.7.Suggested Regulatory Language for Uniformity:For all company auditors (statutory, cost, secretarial and internal), appointment, tenure, remuneration, and independence/peer review requirements should be standardized: Board/AC review, fixed tenure with rotation, appointment/remuneration at SH or board level, and peer review certification (where applicable), to streamline compliance and enhance governance.8.Conclusion:A company's auditor appointment and oversight regime is central to its governance framework and investor confidence. Lack of uniformity in law for cost and internal auditors compared to statutory and secretarial auditors deserves urgent reform.

This is mandated underSection 139of the Companies Act, 2013.\u2022Term of Appointment:\u25cbFor anindividual auditor:The term is5 consecutive years.\u25cbFor anaudit firm:The term istwo consecutive terms of 5 years each(i.e., a total of 10 years).\u25cbAfter completing the maximum term, there is amandatory cooling-off period of 5 yearsbefore the same auditor/audit firm (or a firm with common partners) can be reappointed in the same company (Section 139(2)and related Rules).\u2022Applicability:\u25cbThe rotation and cooling-off requirements aremandatory for listed companies and prescribed classes of public companies(as specified under Rule5of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014).2.Is shareholder ratification of auditor remuneration required for all auditor types?Answer:No. Annual shareholder ratification of remuneration is only legally mandatedfor cost auditors. The requirements for different auditor types are as follows:\u2022Statutory Auditor [Section 142]:Remuneration is fixed by the shareholders at the time of appointment or reappointment in the AGM, in accordance with Section142(1)of the Companies Act, 2013.Annual ratification is not required unless there is a specific change in remuneration or if stipulated by shareholders at the time of appointment.\u2022Cost Auditor: Remuneration is fixed by the Board on the recommendation of the Audit Committee (where applicable), but annual ratification by shareholdersis compulsoryas per Section148(3)of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule14of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014.\u2022Secretarial Auditor:Remuneration is approved by the Board or shareholders (where required) at the time of appointment, as per Section204of the Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR Regulations.Annual ratification is not required unless stipulated in the resolution.\u2022Internal Auditor: Remuneration is approved by the Board of Directors or Audit Committee (as per company policy), with no requirement for shareholder ratification under Section 138 of the Companies Act, 2013 and related rules.3.What is the process for appointing a Cost Auditor?Answer:The appointment of a Cost Auditor is governed bySection 148 of the Companies Act, 2013andRule 14 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014.Step-by-Step Process:1.Recommendation by Audit Committee (if applicable):\u25cbIf the company is required to have an Audit Committee (under Section177of the Companies Act, 2013), theAudit Committee recommends the appointment and remunerationof the cost auditor to the Board [Reference:Rule 14(a) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014]2.Appointment by Board:\u25cbTheBoard of Directors appointsan individual cost accountant or a firm of cost accountants in practice as the cost auditor [Reference:Section 148(3) of the Companies Act, 2013; Rule 14(a)/(b)]3.Remuneration Approval:\u25cbTheremuneration recommended by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board must be ratified by shareholdersat the subsequent general meeting,every financial year [Reference:Section 148(3) of the Companies Act, 2013; Rule 14(a)(ii)/(b)]4.Filing with Registrar of Companies (ROC):\u25cbThe company mustfile a notice of appointment in Form CRA-2 with the ROCwithin 30 days of Board appointment or as prescribed [Reference:Rule6(2)of the Companies (Cost Records and Audit) Rules, 2014]5.Are there peer review requirements for all types of auditors?Answer: No, peer review is not required for all types of auditors.The legal requirements are as follows:(a) Statutory Auditors (Listed Entities) \u2013 Peer Review is mandatory\u2022Reference: Regulation 33(1)(d) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015:\"The listed entity shall ensure that the limited review or audit reports submitted to the stock exchange(s) are given only by an auditor who has subjected himself/herself to the peer review process of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and holds a valid certificate issued by the Peer Review Board of ICAI.\"(b) Secretarial Auditors (Listed Entities) - Peer Review is mandatory\u2022Reference: Regulation 24A(1A) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015(as amended) and SEBICircular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-2/CIR/P/2024/185 dated December 31, 2024:\"A person shall be eligible for appointment as a Secretarial Auditor of the listed entity only if such person is a Peer Reviewed Company Secretary and has not incurred any of the disqualifications as specified by the Board.\"(c) Cost Auditors \u2013 Peer review is not mandatory\u2022No legal requirementfor peer review as per Section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 or the Companies (Cost Records and Audit) Rules, 2014.\u2022Best Practice:Peer review is recommended for large/listed companies but is not mandated by law.(d) Internal Auditors \u2013 peer review is not mandatory\u2022No legal requirementfor peer review as per Section 138 of the Companies Act, 2013 or the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014.\u2022Companiesare free to appoint internal or external qualified professional for its internal audit.6.What is the minimum tenure for internal and cost auditors?Answer:There is no minimum statutory tenure prescribed for internal and cost auditors. By industry practice, they are generally appointed for one financial year at a time and reappointed annually unless the Board decides otherwise.7.What is the \"cooling-off\" period for auditors, and who does it apply to?Answer:After serving the maximum term, statutory and secretarial auditors (for listed entities) are subject to a 5-year cooling-off period before they can be reappointed in the same company. This ensures independence. There is no such requirement for cost or internal auditors.8.Can the same individual or firm act as both statutory and cost auditor?Answer:No. The law expressly prohibits the statutory auditor of a company from acting as its cost auditor to ensure independence of audit.9.What disclosures are required upon appointment of an auditor?Answer:\u2022Statutory Auditor:Upon appointment (or reappointment) of the statutory auditor under Section139of the Companies Act, 2013, the company is required to file Form ADT-1 with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) within 15 days of the meeting in which the auditor is appointed.\u2022Cost Auditor: For appointment of a cost auditor under Section 148, the company must file Form CRA-2 with the RoC within 30 days of the Board meeting in which the cost auditor is appointed, or within 180 days of the commencement of the financial year, whichever is earlier.\u2022Secretarial Auditor: The appointment of a secretarial auditor (Section 204, Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR) is made by Board resolution. While there is no specific e-form prescribed under the Companies Act for appointment of secretarial auditor, if the appointment constitutes a resolution under Section179(3)(i.e., for powers delegated to the Board), the company may file FormMGT-14with the RoC for such board resolution, though this is not universally practiced and is sometimes subject to legal interpretation.\u2022Internal Auditor: Similarly, appointment of an internal auditor (Section 138) is made by the Board and, if the appointment is by a board resolution covered under Section 179(3), Form MGT-14 may be filed for the board resolution, though it is not mandatory under law for all companies.Best Practice:For all auditor appointments, companies should maintain clear board and/or shareholder resolution records, document eligibility, independence, and credentials, and ensure compliance with disclosure requirements of SEBI LODR (where applicable).10.Who approves the appointment of internal auditors?Answer:The Board of Directors or the Audit Committee appoints the internal auditor, depending on the company's structure and applicable regulations. No shareholder approval is required.11.How can boards strengthen auditor appointment and oversight processes?Answer:Boards should establish clear internal policies for the selection, tenure, rotation, and independence of all auditors, conduct annual reviews, and ensure disclosures and processes comply with the Companies Act, SEBI LODR, and industry best practices.12.If the cost auditor's remuneration is not ratified by shareholders, is the appointment valid?Answer:As per Section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule14of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014, annual shareholder ratification of the cost auditor's remuneration is mandatory. If the remuneration is not ratified, the company will be in non-compliance, which may result in regulatory action or objections by the Registrar of Companies.Practical Viewpoint:Some practitioners have suggested operational solutions to reduce the annual compliance burden, such as:\u2022Seeking shareholder approval for a maximum remuneration cap for a period (e.g., not exceeding ?20 lakhs per annum for up to five years), with the Board/Audit Committee authorized to fix remuneration within this limit.\u2022Approving a multi-year remuneration structure upfront (e.g., for five years, with a predetermined annual increment).While these approaches may reduce procedural repetition and are in the spirit of \"ease of doing business,\" they are not expressly recognized in the present statutory framework. Until the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) or relevant regulatory authority issues specific clarification or relaxes the current rules, it is advisable to continue with annual shareholder ratification of cost auditor remuneration to ensure strict compliance.Recommendation:For companies wishing to implement a forward-looking approach, it is prudent to formally represent this to the regulator or seek legal opinion, and to clearly disclose the basis for the approach in the board's proposal and shareholder resolution.13.What happens if the statutory auditor's peer review certificate expires during the term?Answer:If a statutory auditor's peer review certificate lapses, they become ineligible to issue limited review or audit reports for listed companies. The board must ensure timely renewal and may need to take corrective steps if non-compliance is discovered (including considering replacement).14.Can the internal auditor be an employee of the company?Answer:Yes. Internal auditors can be either employees or external professionals (CA, Cost Accountant, or others). However, independence and objectivity should be ensured, especially in large or listed companies15.If a statutory auditor or secretarial auditor is found to have a disqualification after appointment, what should the company do?Answer:If any disqualification arises post-appointment, the auditor must vacate their position immediately. The board should promptly fill the vacancy (as per statutory timelines) and disclose the circumstances in board reports and filings.16.How should the board respond if the Audit Committee and Board disagree on the appointment of an auditor?Answer:If there is a disagreement, the Board must record its reasons and, if not accepting the Audit Committee's recommendation, send its own recommendation to shareholders, explaining both perspectives for a transparent decision at the AGM.17.What governance risk arises if an auditor's independence is compromised (e.g., business relationships, relatives as directors)?Answer:Compromised independence can result in regulatory penalties, voided audits, and loss of stakeholder trust. The board must implement strong pre-appointment vetting, annual independence declarations, and ongoing monitoring.18.Can the same audit firm act as statutory auditor for more than one company within the same group?Answer:Yes, subject to the aggregate audit ceiling and rotation/cooling-off requirements under the Companies Act and SEBI LODR. However, boards should review for potential conflicts of interest or independence issues within the group.19.Is it mandatory to rotate audit partners within an audit firm?Answer:Yes, for listed and prescribed public companies, rotation of audit partners within the firm is mandated by law and ICAI guidelines, even if the audit firm itself continues.20.What steps should the Board take if the statutory auditor resigns mid-term?Answer:The Board (or C&AG for government companies) must fill the casual vacancy within 30 days, and if due to resignation, obtain shareholder approval at a general meeting within three months.21.What is best practice if a cost audit report contains significant qualifications?Answer:The Board should review and respond to every qualification or adverse remark, provide explanations and record the same in board's minutes. The same shall be suitably reported  in the Board's report, and implement corrective action plans to address underlying process or control deficiencies.22.If a company has multiple business units, can it appoint different auditors for each unit?Answer:Generally, a single statutory auditor is appointed for the company as a whole. For cost and internal audits, different auditors may be appointed for different units or divisions, provided oversight, coordination, and reporting are robust.23.How should the Board document and disclose auditor appointments for transparency?Answer:All appointments (and changes) should be minuted, disclosed in Board and AGM resolutions, notified to the ROC as required, and detailed in the corporate governance section of the annual report.24.Can cost auditor also provide other services to the company?Answer:Only if such services do not impair independence or are not expressly prohibited by law or professional standards. The Board should periodically review auditor services to prevent conflicts of interest.25.What should trigger a board-level review of auditor independence and performance?Answer:Triggers include: regulatory notices, NFRA/ICAI observations, recurring audit qualifications, stakeholder concerns, changes in audit team, or material corporate actions (M&A, restructuring).26.How often should Board policy on auditor appointment and oversight be reviewed?Answer:At least annually, and whenever there are changes in law, SEBI or NFRA guidelines, or following any significant audit-related incident.Disclaimer:This article is intended for informational and educational purposes only.

By industry practice, they are generally appointed for one financial year at a time and reappointed annually unless the Board decides otherwise. | 7. |  | What is the \"cooling-off\" period for auditors, and who does it apply to? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | After serving the maximum term, statutory and secretarial auditors (for listed entities) are subject to a 5-year cooling-off period before they can be reappointed in the same company. This ensures independence. There is no such requirement for cost or internal auditors. | 8. |  | Can the same individual or firm act as both statutory and cost auditor? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | No. The law expressly prohibits the statutory auditor of a company from acting as its cost auditor to ensure independence of audit. | 9. |  | What disclosures are required upon appointment of an auditor? |  |  | Answer: | \u2022 |  | Statutory Auditor:Upon appointment (or reappointment) of the statutory auditor under Section139of the Companies Act, 2013, the company is required to file Form ADT-1 with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) within 15 days of the meeting in which the auditor is appointed. | \u2022 |  | Cost Auditor: For appointment of a cost auditor under Section 148, the company must file Form CRA-2 with the RoC within 30 days of the Board meeting in which the cost auditor is appointed, or within 180 days of the commencement of the financial year, whichever is earlier. | \u2022 |  | Secretarial Auditor: The appointment of a secretarial auditor (Section 204, Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR) is made by Board resolution. While there is no specific e-form prescribed under the Companies Act for appointment of secretarial auditor, if the appointment constitutes a resolution under Section179(3)(i.e., for powers delegated to the Board), the company may file FormMGT-14with the RoC for such board resolution, though this is not universally practiced and is sometimes subject to legal interpretation. | \u2022 |  | Internal Auditor: Similarly, appointment of an internal auditor (Section 138) is made by the Board and, if the appointment is by a board resolution covered under Section 179(3), Form MGT-14 may be filed for the board resolution, though it is not mandatory under law for all companies. |  |  | Best Practice:For all auditor appointments, companies should maintain clear board and/or shareholder resolution records, document eligibility, independence, and credentials, and ensure compliance with disclosure requirements of SEBI LODR (where applicable). | 10. |  | Who approves the appointment of internal auditors? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | The Board of Directors or the Audit Committee appoints the internal auditor, depending on the company's structure and applicable regulations. No shareholder approval is required. | 11. |  | How can boards strengthen auditor appointment and oversight processes? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | Boards should establish clear internal policies for the selection, tenure, rotation, and independence of all auditors, conduct annual reviews, and ensure disclosures and processes comply with the Companies Act, SEBI LODR, and industry best practices. | 12. |  | If the cost auditor's remuneration is not ratified by shareholders, is the appointment valid? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | As per Section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule14of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014, annual shareholder ratification of the cost auditor's remuneration is mandatory. If the remuneration is not ratified, the company will be in non-compliance, which may result in regulatory action or objections by the Registrar of Companies. |  |  | Practical Viewpoint:Some practitioners have suggested operational solutions to reduce the annual compliance burden, such as: | \u2022 |  | Seeking shareholder approval for a maximum remuneration cap for a period (e.g., not exceeding ?20 lakhs per annum for up to five years), with the Board/Audit Committee authorized to fix remuneration within this limit. | \u2022 |  | Approving a multi-year remuneration structure upfront (e.g., for five years, with a predetermined annual increment). |  |  | While these approaches may reduce procedural repetition and are in the spirit of \"ease of doing business,\" they are not expressly recognized in the present statutory framework. Until the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) or relevant regulatory authority issues specific clarification or relaxes the current rules, it is advisable to continue with annual shareholder ratification of cost auditor remuneration to ensure strict compliance. |  |  | Recommendation:For companies wishing to implement a forward-looking approach, it is prudent to formally represent this to the regulator or seek legal opinion, and to clearly disclose the basis for the approach in the board's proposal and shareholder resolution. | 13. |  | What happens if the statutory auditor's peer review certificate expires during the term? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | If a statutory auditor's peer review certificate lapses, they become ineligible to issue limited review or audit reports for listed companies. The board must ensure timely renewal and may need to take corrective steps if non-compliance is discovered (including considering replacement). | 14. |  | Can the internal auditor be an employee of the company? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | Yes. Internal auditors can be either employees or external professionals (CA, Cost Accountant, or others). However, independence and objectivity should be ensured, especially in large or listed companies | 15. |  | If a statutory auditor or secretarial auditor is found to have a disqualification after appointment, what should the company do? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | If any disqualification arises post-appointment, the auditor must vacate their position immediately. The board should promptly fill the vacancy (as per statutory timelines) and disclose the circumstances in board reports and filings. | 16. |  | How should the board respond if the Audit Committee and Board disagree on the appointment of an auditor? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | If there is a disagreement, the Board must record its reasons and, if not accepting the Audit Committee's recommendation, send its own recommendation to shareholders, explaining both perspectives for a transparent decision at the AGM. | 17. |  | What governance risk arises if an auditor's independence is compromised (e.g., business relationships, relatives as directors)? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | Compromised independence can result in regulatory penalties, voided audits, and loss of stakeholder trust. The board must implement strong pre-appointment vetting, annual independence declarations, and ongoing monitoring. | 18. |  | Can the same audit firm act as statutory auditor for more than one company within the same group? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | Yes, subject to the aggregate audit ceiling and rotation/cooling-off requirements under the Companies Act and SEBI LODR. However, boards should review for potential conflicts of interest or independence issues within the group. | 19. |  | Is it mandatory to rotate audit partners within an audit firm? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | Yes, for listed and prescribed public companies, rotation of audit partners within the firm is mandated by law and ICAI guidelines, even if the audit firm itself continues. | 20. |  | What steps should the Board take if the statutory auditor resigns mid-term? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | The Board (or C&AG for government companies) must fill the casual vacancy within 30 days, and if due to resignation, obtain shareholder approval at a general meeting within three months. | 21. |  | What is best practice if a cost audit report contains significant qualifications? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | The Board should review and respond to every qualification or adverse remark, provide explanations and record the same in board's minutes. The same shall be suitably reported  in the Board's report, and implement corrective action plans to address underlying process or control deficiencies. | 22. |  | If a company has multiple business units, can it appoint different auditors for each unit? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | Generally, a single statutory auditor is appointed for the company as a whole. For cost and internal audits, different auditors may be appointed for different units or divisions, provided oversight, coordination, and reporting are robust. | 23. |  | How should the Board document and disclose auditor appointments for transparency? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | All appointments (and changes) should be minuted, disclosed in Board and AGM resolutions, notified to the ROC as required, and detailed in the corporate governance section of the annual report. | 24. |  | Can cost auditor also provide other services to the company? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | Only if such services do not impair independence or are not expressly prohibited by law or professional standards. The Board should periodically review auditor services to prevent conflicts of interest. | 25. |  | What should trigger a board-level review of auditor independence and performance? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | Triggers include: regulatory notices, NFRA/ICAI observations, recurring audit qualifications, stakeholder concerns, changes in audit team, or material corporate actions (M&A, restructuring). | 26. |  | How often should Board policy on auditor appointment and oversight be reviewed? |  |  | Answer: |  |  | At least annually, and whenever there are changes in law, SEBI or NFRA guidelines, or following any significant audit-related incident.\n\u2022 |  | Statutory Auditor:External auditor appointed under Section139, Companies Act, 2013.\n\u2022 |  | Cost Auditor:Appointed under Section148, Companies Act, 2013 for prescribed industries.\n\u2022 |  | Secretarial Auditor:Peer-reviewed CS in practice, appointed under Section204and Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR.\n\u2022 |  | Internal Auditor:Professional (CA, Cost Accountant, or otherwise), appointed under Section138for prescribed class of companies.\n\u2022 |  | AC:Audit Committee; SH: Shareholders;CA: Companies Act;LODR: SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.\n1. |  | Auditor Appointment, Tenure, Remuneration & Governance: Comparative Framework:India's governance regime requires four distinct types of auditor appointments. However, the law prescribes different approaches for each. This lack of uniformity creates compliance risk and boardroom confusion. The table below summarizes the key differences.\nAuditor Type | Legal Reference | Tenure / Rotation | Appointment Process & Authority | Shareholder Approval Required | Remuneration Approval / Ratification | Peer Review Required | Key Restrictions / Disqualifications\nStatutory Auditor | Sec. 139, CA; Reg. 33(1)(d) LODR | 5 yrs (individual); 2\u00d75 yrs (firm); 5 yr cooling-off | Board recommends; SH appoint at AGM; rotation for listed/large companies | Yes (at appointment/reappointment) | By SH at appointment; no annual ratification | Yes (for listed entities) | Sec. 141, ICAI, rotation/cooling-off\nCost Auditor | Sec. 148, CA | Not fixed by law; annual by practice | Board appoints (on AC recommendation's if required.), SH ratify remuneration | No (except remuneration) | Board fixes, annual SH ratification required | No | Not statutory auditor of same company; must comply with cost standards\nSecretarial Auditor | Sec. 204, CA; Reg. 24A LODR; SEBI Circular Dec 2024 | 5 yrs (individual); 2\u00d75 yrs (firm); 5 yr cooling-off | Board recommends; SH approve (where required); Peer-reviewed CS | Yes (at appointment/rotation) | Board/SH at appointment; no annual ratification | Yes (for listed entities) | SEBI/ICSI/LODR disqualifications; peer review; prohibited services\nInternal Auditor | Sec. 138, CA | Not fixed by law; annual by practice | Board or AC appoints; can be CA/Cost Accountant/other professional | No | Board fixes; no SH ratification | No | None specified (except eligibility for profession)\nLegend:\u2022SH = Shareholder; AC = Audit Committee; CA = Companies Act. | \u2022 |  | SH = Shareholder; AC = Audit Committee; CA = Companies Act.\n\u2022 |  | SH = Shareholder; AC = Audit Committee; CA = Companies Act.\n |  | For a step-by-step, ready-to-use visual guide to the auditor appointment process for each auditor type, seeAnnexure \u2013 I: Sample Process Flow for Auditor Appointment at the end of this article and FAQ has been given asAnnexure \u2013 II.\n2. |  | Key Gaps and Recommendations:Despite regulatory progress, several critical gaps persist across auditor types. The following table provides targeted, actionable recommendations for boards and regulators.\nGap Area | Recommendation | Intended Outcome\nTenure/Rotation | Fix minimum term/rotation (e.g., 3\u20135 yrs) for cost & internal\nauditors | Continuity, independence, board focus\nRemuneration Ratification | Standardize: Board/SH approval for all at appointment; annual only if material\nchange | Reduces compliance, increases clarity\nPeer Review | Mandate for cost auditor and internal auditor (if\noutsourced/large company /critical business segment) | Raise quality, market trust\nAppointment Process | Uniform process: AC/Board review, SH/Board approval, standard\ndisclosure | Transparency, risk reduction\nPolicy Review | Annual board review of all auditor appointments, independence,\nrotation | Keeps policy current and effective\n3. |  | Boardroom Case Studies: Gaps & Best Practices\n |  | Case Study 1 \u2013 Compliance Miss (Cost Auditor):XYZ Ltd. missed timely reappointment of its cost auditor, assuming last year's approval sufficed. Regulator flagged the lapse, resulting in a penalty and reputational risk.\n |  | Root cause:lack of uniform, automated tracking and unclear tenure policy for cost/internal auditors.\n |  | Model Board Response:\n\u2022 |  | Integrate auditor tenure tracking across all auditor types.\n\u2022 |  | Automate renewal/ratification alerts.\n\u2022 |  | Ensure annual board/AC policy review of all auditor appointments.\n |  | Case Study 2 \u2013 Uniform Policy Success:ABC Ltd. implemented a board-approved, unified auditor appointment policy. Every auditor's eligibility, tenure, remuneration, and independence are tracked in a central system, with annual board oversight. The company passed a surprise regulatory inspection with zero findings.\n |  | Lessons:\n\u2022 |  | Harmonized policies and integrated systems prevent lapses.\n\u2022 |  | Uniform standards across auditor types build trust with regulators and investors.\n4. |  | Model Harmonized Framework for Auditor Appointments:In light of the complex and often fragmented regulatory environment surrounding auditor appointments in India, there is a pressing need for a streamlined and harmonized framework. A model approach can help boards, audit committees, and regulators ensure consistency, transparency, and robust governance\u2014regardless of auditor type. This section proposes a unified framework that integrates best practices and statutory requirements for statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal auditors.\nAspect | Current (Fragmented) | Model Framework (Suggested)\nTenure | 5 yrs for statutory/secretarial; 1 yr or undefined for others | 3\u20135 yrs minimum, mandatory rotation for all auditors\nAppointment | AC/Board/SH combinations vary by auditor | AC/Board review for all, SH approval at appointment/reappointment\nRemuneration | Only cost auditor needs annual ratification | Fixed at appointment for all; annual SH ratification if changed materially\nPeer Review | Statutory/secretarial auditors (listed) only | Peer review for all in large/public companies\nDisclosure | Appointment/remuneration in minutes or filings as required | Standardized, uniform disclosure in board documents and filings\nPolicy Review | Not universal | Annual board policy review for all auditor types\n5. |  | Practical Boardroom Checklist: Auditor Appointment Oversight\n\u2022 |  | Are all auditor appointments, tenures, and remuneration reviewed and documented by the Audit Committee and Board?\n\u2022 |  | Is there an automated system tracking reappointments, ratification deadlines, and peer review status for all auditors?\n\u2022 |  | Is the same rigor applied to cost and internal auditor appointments as for statutory and secretarial auditors?\n\u2022 |  | Are all regulatory filings (ADT-1, resolutions, etc.) completed timely for each appointment?\n\u2022 |  | Has the board reviewed the policy and updated it for new regulations this year?\n6. |  | Boardroom and Regulatory Action Points\n\u2022 |  | Unify Policies: Approve a board policy covering all auditor types\u2014statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal.\n\u2022 |  | Automate Compliance: Use digital tools to track appointment, tenure, and peer review status.\n\u2022 |  | Standardize Disclosure: Require uniform appointment and remuneration disclosure in all board and shareholder documentation.\n\u2022 |  | Regular Policy Review: Mandate annual review of auditor appointment/rotation/remuneration policy at board and AC meetings.\n\u2022 |  | Engage with Regulators: Provide feedback on harmonizing tenure, remuneration, and peer review rules to support ease of doing business.\n7. |  | Suggested Regulatory Language for Uniformity:For all company auditors (statutory, cost, secretarial and internal), appointment, tenure, remuneration, and independence/peer review requirements should be standardized: Board/AC review, fixed tenure with rotation, appointment/remuneration at SH or board level, and peer review certification (where applicable), to streamline compliance and enhance governance.\n8. |  | Conclusion:A company's auditor appointment and oversight regime is central to its governance framework and investor confidence. Lack of uniformity in law for cost and internal auditors compared to statutory and secretarial auditors deserves urgent reform. Rationalizing tenure, appointment, remuneration, and peer review standards across all auditors will elevate both governance and audit quality, supporting India's \"ease of doing business\" vision.\nStep | Statutory Auditor | Cost Auditor | Secretarial Auditor | Internal Auditor\nEligibility Check | Board/AC reviews, ICAI/peer review certificate required | Board/AC reviews; eligibility under CA, cost standards | Board/AC reviews, Peer-reviewed CS required | Board/AC reviews, CA/Cost Accountant/Other\nRecommendation | AC to Board to SH | AC (if required) to Board | Board/AC to SH (as required) | AC/Board\nAppointment | SH at AGM | Board (remuneration: SH ratify) | Board/SH (as required) | Board/AC\nTenure/Rotation | 5 yrs (individual)/2\u00d75 (firm) | 1 yr by practice | 5 yrs (individual)/2\u00d75 (firm) | Annual by practice\nRemuneration | SH at appointment | Board, SH ratify annually | Board/SH at appointment | Board\nDisclosure | ADT-1, minutes | Resolution, minutes | Resolution, minutes | Minutes\n1. |  | Who appoints the Statutory Auditor, and what is the term?\n |  | Answer:Thestatutory auditoris appointed by theshareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), based on the recommendation of theAudit Committee(where applicable, as per Section177) and theBoard of Directors.

There is no such requirement for cost or internal auditors.\n8. |  | Can the same individual or firm act as both statutory and cost auditor?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | No. The law expressly prohibits the statutory auditor of a company from acting as its cost auditor to ensure independence of audit.\n9. |  | What disclosures are required upon appointment of an auditor?\n |  | Answer:\n\u2022 |  | Statutory Auditor:Upon appointment (or reappointment) of the statutory auditor under Section139of the Companies Act, 2013, the company is required to file Form ADT-1 with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) within 15 days of the meeting in which the auditor is appointed.\n\u2022 |  | Cost Auditor: For appointment of a cost auditor under Section 148, the company must file Form CRA-2 with the RoC within 30 days of the Board meeting in which the cost auditor is appointed, or within 180 days of the commencement of the financial year, whichever is earlier.\n\u2022 |  | Secretarial Auditor: The appointment of a secretarial auditor (Section 204, Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR) is made by Board resolution. While there is no specific e-form prescribed under the Companies Act for appointment of secretarial auditor, if the appointment constitutes a resolution under Section179(3)(i.e., for powers delegated to the Board), the company may file FormMGT-14with the RoC for such board resolution, though this is not universally practiced and is sometimes subject to legal interpretation.\n\u2022 |  | Internal Auditor: Similarly, appointment of an internal auditor (Section 138) is made by the Board and, if the appointment is by a board resolution covered under Section 179(3), Form MGT-14 may be filed for the board resolution, though it is not mandatory under law for all companies.\n |  | Best Practice:For all auditor appointments, companies should maintain clear board and/or shareholder resolution records, document eligibility, independence, and credentials, and ensure compliance with disclosure requirements of SEBI LODR (where applicable).\n10. |  | Who approves the appointment of internal auditors?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | The Board of Directors or the Audit Committee appoints the internal auditor, depending on the company's structure and applicable regulations. No shareholder approval is required.\n11. |  | How can boards strengthen auditor appointment and oversight processes?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | Boards should establish clear internal policies for the selection, tenure, rotation, and independence of all auditors, conduct annual reviews, and ensure disclosures and processes comply with the Companies Act, SEBI LODR, and industry best practices.\n12. |  | If the cost auditor's remuneration is not ratified by shareholders, is the appointment valid?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | As per Section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule14of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014, annual shareholder ratification of the cost auditor's remuneration is mandatory. If the remuneration is not ratified, the company will be in non-compliance, which may result in regulatory action or objections by the Registrar of Companies.\n |  | Practical Viewpoint:Some practitioners have suggested operational solutions to reduce the annual compliance burden, such as:\n\u2022 |  | Seeking shareholder approval for a maximum remuneration cap for a period (e.g., not exceeding ?20 lakhs per annum for up to five years), with the Board/Audit Committee authorized to fix remuneration within this limit.\n\u2022 |  | Approving a multi-year remuneration structure upfront (e.g., for five years, with a predetermined annual increment).\n |  | While these approaches may reduce procedural repetition and are in the spirit of \"ease of doing business,\" they are not expressly recognized in the present statutory framework. Until the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) or relevant regulatory authority issues specific clarification or relaxes the current rules, it is advisable to continue with annual shareholder ratification of cost auditor remuneration to ensure strict compliance.\n |  | Recommendation:For companies wishing to implement a forward-looking approach, it is prudent to formally represent this to the regulator or seek legal opinion, and to clearly disclose the basis for the approach in the board's proposal and shareholder resolution.\n13. |  | What happens if the statutory auditor's peer review certificate expires during the term?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | If a statutory auditor's peer review certificate lapses, they become ineligible to issue limited review or audit reports for listed companies. The board must ensure timely renewal and may need to take corrective steps if non-compliance is discovered (including considering replacement).\n14. |  | Can the internal auditor be an employee of the company?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | Yes. Internal auditors can be either employees or external professionals (CA, Cost Accountant, or others). However, independence and objectivity should be ensured, especially in large or listed companies\n15. |  | If a statutory auditor or secretarial auditor is found to have a disqualification after appointment, what should the company do?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | If any disqualification arises post-appointment, the auditor must vacate their position immediately. The board should promptly fill the vacancy (as per statutory timelines) and disclose the circumstances in board reports and filings.\n16. |  | How should the board respond if the Audit Committee and Board disagree on the appointment of an auditor?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | If there is a disagreement, the Board must record its reasons and, if not accepting the Audit Committee's recommendation, send its own recommendation to shareholders, explaining both perspectives for a transparent decision at the AGM.\n17. |  | What governance risk arises if an auditor's independence is compromised (e.g., business relationships, relatives as directors)?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | Compromised independence can result in regulatory penalties, voided audits, and loss of stakeholder trust. The board must implement strong pre-appointment vetting, annual independence declarations, and ongoing monitoring.\n18. |  | Can the same audit firm act as statutory auditor for more than one company within the same group?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | Yes, subject to the aggregate audit ceiling and rotation/cooling-off requirements under the Companies Act and SEBI LODR. However, boards should review for potential conflicts of interest or independence issues within the group.\n19. |  | Is it mandatory to rotate audit partners within an audit firm?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | Yes, for listed and prescribed public companies, rotation of audit partners within the firm is mandated by law and ICAI guidelines, even if the audit firm itself continues.\n20. |  | What steps should the Board take if the statutory auditor resigns mid-term?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | The Board (or C&AG for government companies) must fill the casual vacancy within 30 days, and if due to resignation, obtain shareholder approval at a general meeting within three months.\n21. |  | What is best practice if a cost audit report contains significant qualifications?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | The Board should review and respond to every qualification or adverse remark, provide explanations and record the same in board's minutes. The same shall be suitably reported  in the Board's report, and implement corrective action plans to address underlying process or control deficiencies.\n22. |  | If a company has multiple business units, can it appoint different auditors for each unit?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | Generally, a single statutory auditor is appointed for the company as a whole. For cost and internal audits, different auditors may be appointed for different units or divisions, provided oversight, coordination, and reporting are robust.\n23. |  | How should the Board document and disclose auditor appointments for transparency?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | All appointments (and changes) should be minuted, disclosed in Board and AGM resolutions, notified to the ROC as required, and detailed in the corporate governance section of the annual report.\n24. |  | Can cost auditor also provide other services to the company?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | Only if such services do not impair independence or are not expressly prohibited by law or professional standards. The Board should periodically review auditor services to prevent conflicts of interest.\n25. |  | What should trigger a board-level review of auditor independence and performance?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | Triggers include: regulatory notices, NFRA/ICAI observations, recurring audit qualifications, stakeholder concerns, changes in audit team, or material corporate actions (M&A, restructuring).\n26. |  | How often should Board policy on auditor appointment and oversight be reviewed?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | At least annually, and whenever there are changes in law, SEBI or NFRA guidelines, or following any significant audit-related incident.\n\n\nTable:\n\u2022 |  | Statutory Auditor:External auditor appointed under Section139, Companies Act, 2013.\n\u2022 |  | Cost Auditor:Appointed under Section148, Companies Act, 2013 for prescribed industries.\n\u2022 |  | Secretarial Auditor:Peer-reviewed CS in practice, appointed under Section204and Regulation 24A of SEBI LODR.\n\u2022 |  | Internal Auditor:Professional (CA, Cost Accountant, or otherwise), appointed under Section138for prescribed class of companies.\n\u2022 |  | AC:Audit Committee; SH: Shareholders;CA: Companies Act;LODR: SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.\n\n\nTable:\n1. |  | Auditor Appointment, Tenure, Remuneration & Governance: Comparative Framework:India's governance regime requires four distinct types of auditor appointments. However, the law prescribes different approaches for each. This lack of uniformity creates compliance risk and boardroom confusion. The table below summarizes the key differences.\n\n\nTable:\nAuditor Type | Legal Reference | Tenure / Rotation | Appointment Process & Authority | Shareholder Approval Required | Remuneration Approval / Ratification | Peer Review Required | Key Restrictions / Disqualifications\nStatutory Auditor | Sec. 139, CA; Reg. 33(1)(d) LODR | 5 yrs (individual); 2\u00d75 yrs (firm); 5 yr cooling-off | Board recommends; SH appoint at AGM; rotation for listed/large companies | Yes (at appointment/reappointment) | By SH at appointment; no annual ratification | Yes (for listed entities) | Sec. 141, ICAI, rotation/cooling-off\nCost Auditor | Sec. 148, CA | Not fixed by law; annual by practice | Board appoints (on AC recommendation's if required.), SH ratify remuneration | No (except remuneration) | Board fixes, annual SH ratification required | No | Not statutory auditor of same company; must comply with cost standards\nSecretarial Auditor | Sec. 204, CA; Reg. 24A LODR; SEBI Circular Dec 2024 | 5 yrs (individual); 2\u00d75 yrs (firm); 5 yr cooling-off | Board recommends; SH approve (where required); Peer-reviewed CS | Yes (at appointment/rotation) | Board/SH at appointment; no annual ratification | Yes (for listed entities) | SEBI/ICSI/LODR disqualifications; peer review; prohibited services\nInternal Auditor | Sec. 138, CA | Not fixed by law; annual by practice | Board or AC appoints; can be CA/Cost Accountant/other professional | No | Board fixes; no SH ratification | No | None specified (except eligibility for profession)\nLegend:\u2022SH = Shareholder; AC = Audit Committee; CA = Companies Act. | \u2022 |  | SH = Shareholder; AC = Audit Committee; CA = Companies Act.\n\u2022 |  | SH = Shareholder; AC = Audit Committee; CA = Companies Act.\n\n\nTable:\n\u2022 |  | SH = Shareholder; AC = Audit Committee; CA = Companies Act.\n\n\nTable:\n |  | For a step-by-step, ready-to-use visual guide to the auditor appointment process for each auditor type, seeAnnexure \u2013 I: Sample Process Flow for Auditor Appointment at the end of this article and FAQ has been given asAnnexure \u2013 II.\n2. |  | Key Gaps and Recommendations:Despite regulatory progress, several critical gaps persist across auditor types. The following table provides targeted, actionable recommendations for boards and regulators.\n\n\nTable:\nGap Area | Recommendation | Intended Outcome\nTenure/Rotation | Fix minimum term/rotation (e.g., 3\u20135 yrs) for cost & internal\nauditors | Continuity, independence, board focus\nRemuneration Ratification | Standardize: Board/SH approval for all at appointment; annual only if material\nchange | Reduces compliance, increases clarity\nPeer Review | Mandate for cost auditor and internal auditor (if\noutsourced/large company /critical business segment) | Raise quality, market trust\nAppointment Process | Uniform process: AC/Board review, SH/Board approval, standard\ndisclosure | Transparency, risk reduction\nPolicy Review | Annual board review of all auditor appointments, independence,\nrotation | Keeps policy current and effective\n\n\nTable:\n3. |  | Boardroom Case Studies: Gaps & Best Practices\n |  | Case Study 1 \u2013 Compliance Miss (Cost Auditor):XYZ Ltd. missed timely reappointment of its cost auditor, assuming last year's approval sufficed. Regulator flagged the lapse, resulting in a penalty and reputational risk.\n |  | Root cause:lack of uniform, automated tracking and unclear tenure policy for cost/internal auditors.\n |  | Model Board Response:\n\n\nTable:\n\u2022 |  | Integrate auditor tenure tracking across all auditor types.\n\u2022 |  | Automate renewal/ratification alerts.\n\u2022 |  | Ensure annual board/AC policy review of all auditor appointments.\n\n\nTable:\n |  | Case Study 2 \u2013 Uniform Policy Success:ABC Ltd. implemented a board-approved, unified auditor appointment policy. Every auditor's eligibility, tenure, remuneration, and independence are tracked in a central system, with annual board oversight. The company passed a surprise regulatory inspection with zero findings.\n |  | Lessons:\n\n\nTable:\n\u2022 |  | Harmonized policies and integrated systems prevent lapses.\n\u2022 |  | Uniform standards across auditor types build trust with regulators and investors.\n\n\nTable:\n4. |  | Model Harmonized Framework for Auditor Appointments:In light of the complex and often fragmented regulatory environment surrounding auditor appointments in India, there is a pressing need for a streamlined and harmonized framework. A model approach can help boards, audit committees, and regulators ensure consistency, transparency, and robust governance\u2014regardless of auditor type. This section proposes a unified framework that integrates best practices and statutory requirements for statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal auditors.\n\n\nTable:\nAspect | Current (Fragmented) | Model Framework (Suggested)\nTenure | 5 yrs for statutory/secretarial; 1 yr or undefined for others | 3\u20135 yrs minimum, mandatory rotation for all auditors\nAppointment | AC/Board/SH combinations vary by auditor | AC/Board review for all, SH approval at appointment/reappointment\nRemuneration | Only cost auditor needs annual ratification | Fixed at appointment for all; annual SH ratification if changed materially\nPeer Review | Statutory/secretarial auditors (listed) only | Peer review for all in large/public companies\nDisclosure | Appointment/remuneration in minutes or filings as required | Standardized, uniform disclosure in board documents and filings\nPolicy Review | Not universal | Annual board policy review for all auditor types\n\n\nTable:\n5. |  | Practical Boardroom Checklist: Auditor Appointment Oversight\n\n\nTable:\n\u2022 |  | Are all auditor appointments, tenures, and remuneration reviewed and documented by the Audit Committee and Board?\n\u2022 |  | Is there an automated system tracking reappointments, ratification deadlines, and peer review status for all auditors?\n\u2022 |  | Is the same rigor applied to cost and internal auditor appointments as for statutory and secretarial auditors?\n\u2022 |  | Are all regulatory filings (ADT-1, resolutions, etc.) completed timely for each appointment?\n\u2022 |  | Has the board reviewed the policy and updated it for new regulations this year?\n\n\nTable:\n6. |  | Boardroom and Regulatory Action Points\n\n\nTable:\n\u2022 |  | Unify Policies: Approve a board policy covering all auditor types\u2014statutory, cost, secretarial, and internal.\n\u2022 |  | Automate Compliance: Use digital tools to track appointment, tenure, and peer review status.\n\u2022 |  | Standardize Disclosure: Require uniform appointment and remuneration disclosure in all board and shareholder documentation.\n\u2022 |  | Regular Policy Review: Mandate annual review of auditor appointment/rotation/remuneration policy at board and AC meetings.\n\u2022 |  | Engage with Regulators: Provide feedback on harmonizing tenure, remuneration, and peer review rules to support ease of doing business.\n\n\nTable:\n7. |  | Suggested Regulatory Language for Uniformity:For all company auditors (statutory, cost, secretarial and internal), appointment, tenure, remuneration, and independence/peer review requirements should be standardized: Board/AC review, fixed tenure with rotation, appointment/remuneration at SH or board level, and peer review certification (where applicable), to streamline compliance and enhance governance.\n8. |  | Conclusion:A company's auditor appointment and oversight regime is central to its governance framework and investor confidence. Lack of uniformity in law for cost and internal auditors compared to statutory and secretarial auditors deserves urgent reform. Rationalizing tenure, appointment, remuneration, and peer review standards across all auditors will elevate both governance and audit quality, supporting India's \"ease of doing business\" vision.\n\n\nTable:\nStep | Statutory Auditor | Cost Auditor | Secretarial Auditor | Internal Auditor\nEligibility Check | Board/AC reviews, ICAI/peer review certificate required | Board/AC reviews; eligibility under CA, cost standards | Board/AC reviews, Peer-reviewed CS required | Board/AC reviews, CA/Cost Accountant/Other\nRecommendation | AC to Board to SH | AC (if required) to Board | Board/AC to SH (as required) | AC/Board\nAppointment | SH at AGM | Board (remuneration: SH ratify) | Board/SH (as required) | Board/AC\nTenure/Rotation | 5 yrs (individual)/2\u00d75 (firm) | 1 yr by practice | 5 yrs (individual)/2\u00d75 (firm) | Annual by practice\nRemuneration | SH at appointment | Board, SH ratify annually | Board/SH at appointment | Board\nDisclosure | ADT-1, minutes | Resolution, minutes | Resolution, minutes | Minutes\n\n\nTable:\n1. |  | Who appoints the Statutory Auditor, and what is the term?\n |  | Answer:Thestatutory auditoris appointed by theshareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), based on the recommendation of theAudit Committee(where applicable, as per Section177) and theBoard of Directors.

For cost and internal audits, different auditors may be appointed for different units or divisions, provided oversight, coordination, and reporting are robust.\n23. |  | How should the Board document and disclose auditor appointments for transparency?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | All appointments (and changes) should be minuted, disclosed in Board and AGM resolutions, notified to the ROC as required, and detailed in the corporate governance section of the annual report.\n24. |  | Can cost auditor also provide other services to the company?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | Only if such services do not impair independence or are not expressly prohibited by law or professional standards. The Board should periodically review auditor services to prevent conflicts of interest.\n25. |  | What should trigger a board-level review of auditor independence and performance?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | Triggers include: regulatory notices, NFRA/ICAI observations, recurring audit qualifications, stakeholder concerns, changes in audit team, or material corporate actions (M&A, restructuring).\n26. |  | How often should Board policy on auditor appointment and oversight be reviewed?\n |  | Answer:\n |  | At least annually, and whenever there are changes in law, SEBI or NFRA guidelines, or following any significant audit-related incident.\n",

Director Identification Number (DIN) is a unique identification number, allotted by the Central Government to each of the aspiring individual who would like to be director of any company. The DIN number is allotted by the Central Government and is valid for the lifetime of the director. As per the provisions of Companies Act 2013, that an individual should have a valid DIN number for him / her to be appointed as a director in any company. Obviously, it means, any individual who is already a director would be having the DIN number.  The framework of the Companies Act 2013 provides certain restrictions and prohibition to obtain more than one DIN number.  As per the provisions of the Companies Act 2013, no person who already has a DIN number shall apply for another DIN number which means, one DIN number for each of the director. Further the Companies Act 2013 read with relevant rules also provide for the surrender of DIN number and the DIN number can be surrendered by making an application to the Central Government in the specified e-form on the ground that the individual concerned was never been appointed as director in any company and also the DIN number never been used for filing any document with any authority. Relevant provisions relating DIN under the Companies Act 2013 2. Section 155 of the Companies Act 2013 provides that no individual, who has already been allotted a Director Identification Number (DIN) under section 154 shall apply for, obtain or process another Director Identification Number. Penal provision for default / violation 3. Section 159 of the of the Companies Act 2013 provides that if any individual or director of a company makes any default in complying with any of the provisions of section 152 , section 155 and section 156 such individual or director of the company shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to fifty thousand rupees and where the default is a continuing one, with a further penalty which may extend to five hundred rupees for each days after the first during which such default continues. Consequences of default if any and the relevant case law 4. As the provisions of law, prohibits in obtaining more than one DIN by a director, any violation to the above provision i.e. obtaining more than one DIN would constitute the violation of the provisions of the Companies Act 2013 and the regulators would initiate penal action and levy the penalty as provided under the Companies Act 2013.

We can conclude in saying that any director obtaining Director Identification Number (DIN) should keep in mind that the DIN is allotted by the Government to each of the aspiring individual who would like to be director of any company and the same is valid for the lifetime of the director. Further, the law prohibits in obtaining more than one DIN number and also the law says, the DIN could be surrendered any time by an individual when the DIN number never been used. The directors should keep this mind and ensure that they always have only one DIN number and if they happen to obtain another DIN then \u2013 though this may appear as a trivial matter would attract penalty and fines, in view of the provisions of the Companies Act 2013 as has been in this case.

Agrawal Founder, Aventaa Global Advisors LLP\nSuraj R. Agrawal\nFounder, Aventaa Global Advisors LLP\n\nA Quiet Change That Made a Big Difference Think about how much money you made when you sold a piece of property. Now you have a big tax bill in front of you. But what if you could help India switch to clean energy and save money on taxes at the same time? This is now real. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) sent out a notice on July 9, 2025, that is sure to make both investors and environmentalists happy. It is officially called bonds issued by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), \"long-term specified assets\" under Section 54EC of the Income Tax Act, 1961. These bonds can be redeemed after five years. In other words? You can now put the money you made from selling land or buildings into these IREDA bonds and not have to pay capital gains tax on it. But this isn't just about saving money on taxes; it's also about moving investment money into clean, long-lasting infrastructure. That's where the bigger story starts. Why This Matters Now: Bringing Together Tax Planning and Climate Action Every policy that directs money toward renewable energy is important right now because India is working hard to reach its net-zero goals. By 2030, the country wants to have 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity. We need more than just policies; we need deep pockets as well. This is where the new 54EC name for IREDA bonds really starts to change things. For a long time, Section 54EC has been a good way to plan taxes. At first, bonds from organizations like the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) were eligible. These allowed people and businesses to put long-term capital gains into government-backed infrastructure projects for five years, during which time they would not have to pay taxes on those gains. IREDA is now a member of this elite group, but with a green twist. What Has Actually Changed in the Notification? Let's break this notification down into simple terms: \u2022 What's going on? As of July 9, 2025, IREDA bonds that can be redeemed after five years are now considered \"long-term specified assets\" under Section 54EC. \u2022 What is IREDA? The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency is a government-owned, non-banking financial institution that gives money to projects that use renewable energy. \u2022 What's the catch? The money made from these bonds must be used for renewable energy projects that can pay for themselves, meaning they should make enough money to pay off the debt without needing help from the state government. This last part is very important. It makes sure that the money that was put in isn't wasted on projects that aren't working or that are politically unstable. Instead, it goes to green businesses that make money and are financially stable. A Quick Overview of Section 54EC Before we go any further, let's take a moment to understand how Section 54EC works: \u2022 You make capital gains when you sell a long-term capital asset, like land or a building. \u2022 If you invest those gains in certain government-approved bonds within six months, you won't have to pay taxes on them. \u2022 The maximum amount you can invest right now is \u20b950 lakhs per year. \u2022 The bonds can't be sold or traded, and they have a five-year lock-in period. \u2022 You get your principal back after the lock-in period, and during that time, you may earn a small amount of interest (usually between 5% and 5.25%). With IREDA bonds, your investment can now also be a vote of confidence in India's future as a country that uses clean energy. The Strategic Move Toward Green Capital This notice is more than just a change in taxes. It shows a bigger shift in India's policy framework: making sure that financial incentives are in line with sustainability goals. This is a small but smart step that India is taking to improve its green finance ecosystem. The government is using tax laws to push people to do the right thing without making them do it. They are doing this by encouraging people to invest in environmentally friendly assets. That's a smart move from a policy design point of view. Behavioral economics calls this a \"nudge.\" It means making the easier or more appealing path also the one that is better for society. Also, the fact that IREDA can only use money on renewable projects that can pay for themselves shows that they are being careful with their money. It stops people from misusing public money and keeps the focus on quality over quantity in green investments. What This Means for People Who Invest This gives investors another way to save money on taxes while supporting clean energy. But there are a few things to think about that go beyond the surface: \u2022 54EC Options are more diverse now that IREDA is in the mix. NHAI and REC used to be the only players in this space. This is appealing to smart investors who want to get into the green sector without taking on stock market risks. \u2022 Moral Satisfaction with Fiscal Prudence: Investors who care about the environment but are also careful with their money often have to choose between getting a good return and being responsible. IREDA bonds are a good choice because they are stable, backed by the government, and good for the environment. \u2022 Reputational Signaling for High Net Worth Individuals and Businesses: Businesses and wealthy people can now make their tax plans match their ESG commitments. Picture a CSR report from a company that says, \"We put our profits into India's renewable energy future.\" What does this means for the renewable energy sector This step could open up a steady flow of money for renewable projects. It might not seem like much for one person to pay \u20b950 lakh a year, but when you add that up for thousands of taxpayers, it becomes a lot. As a lender, IREDA can now get money from a source that is more diverse and may be less volatile. This could make it less reliant on budgetary support or borrowing from other countries, which would give it more freedom and flexibility. The policy also weeds out projects that won't make money by only allowing those that will. This makes people plan and carry out their projects better. Tax law as a tool for climate policy: the big picture Tax law has been used before to help the country reach its goals, but this is one of the more elegant ways to do it. This is different from direct subsidies, which are politically sensitive and often don't work well. The government isn't spending money here; instead, it's giving up money in a targeted way to encourage investment in clean energy. There is a big benefit to the environment. India has some of the dirtiest cities in the world and still relies heavily on coal. These funds can help build solar or wind power plants that can replace fossil fuel-based power plants. This action also sends a message to the world\u2014multilaterals, foreign investors, and climate activists\u2014that India is serious about its climate promises and is willing to back them up with real, investor-friendly ways. Things to Keep an Eye On Of course, there are possible problems. Here are some that will need close attention: \u2022 Interest Rates and Inflation: If IREDA bonds have a fixed rate and inflation goes up, the real returns could go down, making them less appealing. \u2022 Awareness: A lot of taxpayers still don't fully understand or use Section 54EC. Getting the word out to the public is very important. \u2022 Liquidity Problems: Investors who need money quickly may not want to invest if there is a five-year lock-in period. \u2022 Project Monitoring: To make sure that bond money is only used for qualified projects and not for anything else, strict oversight is needed. Looking Ahead: A Green Plan for Financial Changes CBDT has done more than just add to the list of tax exemptions here. It has set an example for other fields to follow. Think about how great it would be if we had tax-free investment options like these for: \u2022 Affordable housing (other than Section 80-IBA ) \u2022 Agricultural infrastructure \u2022 Ecosystems for electric vehicles \u2022 Projects that turn trash into energy India could use any of these as a tool for development. The most important things are being open, making sure people are responsible, and designing with the end user in mind. Conclusion: A Win-Win That Needs More Attention In a world full of policy headlines, this CBDT notice might look like a small detail. But if you look deeper, you can see a strong connection between fiscal strategy, environmental protection, and investment opportunities. The government has not only encouraged taxpayers by recognizing IREDA bonds under Section 54EC, but it has also put private money to good use without putting a strain on the treasury. It was a clean, quiet win that needs more attention. If you're a taxpayer who wants to make money, an investor who wants to do more than just make money, or someone who just wants India to be greener, this might be your chance to put your money where your heart is. The next question is: Will enough people see it? \u25a0\u25a0 \u00a9 Copyright Taxmann. No part can be copied or circulated without the permission of Taxmann.\n\u2022\n\nWhat's going on?

AgrawalFounder, Aventaa Global Advisors LLP\nA Quiet Change That Made a Big DifferenceThink about how much money you made when you sold a piece of property. Now you have a big tax bill in front of you. But what if you could help India switch to clean energy and save money on taxes at the same time?This is now real.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) sent out a notice on July 9, 2025, that is sure to make both investors and environmentalists happy. It is officially called bonds issued by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), \"long-term specified assets\" under Section54ECof the Income Tax Act, 1961. These bonds can be redeemed after five years.In other words? You can now put the money you made from selling land or buildings into these IREDA bonds and not have to pay capital gains tax on it.But this isn't just about saving money on taxes; it's also about moving investment money into clean, long-lasting infrastructure. That's where the bigger story starts.Why This Matters Now: Bringing Together Tax Planning and Climate ActionEvery policy that directs money toward renewable energy is important right now because India is working hard to reach its net-zero goals. By 2030, the country wants to have 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity. We need more than just policies; we need deep pockets as well.This is where the new 54EC name for IREDA bonds really starts to change things.For a long time, Section 54EC has been a good way to plan taxes. At first, bonds from organizations like the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) were eligible. These allowed people and businesses to put long-term capital gains into government-backed infrastructure projects for five years, during which time they would not have to pay taxes on those gains.IREDA is now a member of this elite group, but with a green twist.What Has Actually Changed in the Notification?Let's break this notification down into simple terms:\u2022What's going on? As of July 9, 2025, IREDA bonds that can be redeemed after five years are now considered \"long-term specified assets\" under Section 54EC.\u2022What is IREDA? The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency is a government-owned, non-banking financial institution that gives money to projects that use renewable energy.\u2022What's the catch? The money made from these bonds must be used for renewable energy projects that can pay for themselves, meaning they should make enough money to pay off the debt without needing help from the state government.This last part is very important. It makes sure that the money that was put in isn't wasted on projects that aren't working or that are politically unstable. Instead, it goes to green businesses that make money and are financially stable.A Quick Overview of Section 54ECBefore we go any further, let's take a moment to understand how Section 54EC works:\u2022You make capital gains when you sell a long-term capital asset, like land or a building.\u2022If you invest those gains in certain government-approved bonds within six months, you won't have to pay taxes on them.\u2022The maximum amount you can invest right now is \u20b950 lakhs per year.\u2022The bonds can't be sold or traded, and they have a five-year lock-in period.\u2022You get your principal back after the lock-in period, and during that time, you may earn a small amount of interest (usually between 5% and 5.25%).With IREDA bonds, your investment can now also be a vote of confidence in India's future as a country that uses clean energy.The Strategic Move Toward Green CapitalThis notice is more than just a change in taxes. It shows a bigger shift in India's policy framework: making sure that financial incentives are in line with sustainability goals.This is a small but smart step that India is taking to improve its green finance ecosystem. The government is using tax laws to push people to do the right thing without making them do it. They are doing this by encouraging people to invest in environmentally friendly assets.That's a smart move from a policy design point of view. Behavioral economics calls this a \"nudge.\" It means making the easier or more appealing path also the one that is better for society.Also, the fact that IREDA can only use money on renewable projects that can pay for themselves shows that they are being careful with their money. It stops people from misusing public money and keeps the focus on quality over quantity in green investments.What This Means for People Who InvestThis gives investors another way to save money on taxes while supporting clean energy. But there are a few things to think about that go beyond the surface:\u202254EC Options are more diverse now that IREDA is in the mix. NHAI and REC used to be the only players in this space. This is appealing to smart investors who want to get into the green sector without taking on stock market risks.\u2022Moral Satisfaction with Fiscal Prudence: Investors who care about the environment but are also careful with their money often have to choose between getting a good return and being responsible. IREDA bonds are a good choice because they are stable, backed by the government, and good for the environment.\u2022Reputational Signaling for High Net Worth Individuals and Businesses: Businesses and wealthy people can now make their tax plans match their ESG commitments. Picture a CSR report from a company that says, \"We put our profits into India's renewable energy future.\"What does this means for the renewable energy sectorThis step could open up a steady flow of money for renewable projects. It might not seem like much for one person to pay \u20b950 lakh a year, but when you add that up for thousands of taxpayers, it becomes a lot.As a lender, IREDA can now get money from a source that is more diverse and may be less volatile. This could make it less reliant on budgetary support or borrowing from other countries, which would give it more freedom and flexibility.The policy also weeds out projects that won't make money by only allowing those that will. This makes people plan and carry out their projects better.Tax law as a tool for climate policy: the big pictureTax law has been used before to help the country reach its goals, but this is one of the more elegant ways to do it.This is different from direct subsidies, which are politically sensitive and often don't work well. The government isn't spending money here; instead, it's giving up money in a targeted way to encourage investment in clean energy.There is a big benefit to the environment. India has some of the dirtiest cities in the world and still relies heavily on coal. These funds can help build solar or wind power plants that can replace fossil fuel-based power plants.This action also sends a message to the world\u2014multilaterals, foreign investors, and climate activists\u2014that India is serious about its climate promises and is willing to back them up with real, investor-friendly ways.Things to Keep an Eye OnOf course, there are possible problems. Here are some that will need close attention:\u2022Interest Rates and Inflation: If IREDA bonds have a fixed rate and inflation goes up, the real returns could go down, making them less appealing.\u2022Awareness: A lot of taxpayers still don't fully understand or use Section 54EC. Getting the word out to the public is very important.\u2022Liquidity Problems: Investors who need money quickly may not want to invest if there is a five-year lock-in period.\u2022Project Monitoring: To make sure that bond money is only used for qualified projects and not for anything else, strict oversight is needed.Looking Ahead: A Green Plan for Financial ChangesCBDT has done more than just add to the list of tax exemptions here. It has set an example for other fields to follow.Think about how great it would be if we had tax-free investment options like these for:\u2022Affordable housing (other than Section80-IBA)\u2022Agricultural infrastructure\u2022Ecosystems for electric vehicles\u2022Projects that turn trash into energyIndia could use any of these as a tool for development. The most important things are being open, making sure people are responsible, and designing with the end user in mind.Conclusion: A Win-Win That Needs More AttentionIn a world full of policy headlines, this CBDT notice might look like a small detail. But if you look deeper, you can see a strong connection between fiscal strategy, environmental protection, and investment opportunities.The government has not only encouraged taxpayers by recognizing IREDA bonds under Section 54EC, but it has also put private money to good use without putting a strain on the treasury.It was a clean, quiet win that needs more attention.If you're a taxpayer who wants to make money, an investor who wants to do more than just make money, or someone who just wants India to be greener, this might be your chance to put your money where your heart is.The next question is: Will enough people see it?\u25a0\u25a0\u00a9Copyright Taxmann.

S M Mohanka & Associates & Founder Director in Tax Aaram India Pvt. Ltd.\nMayank Mohanka\nSenior Partner in M/s. S M Mohanka & Associates & Founder Director in Tax Aaram India Pvt. Ltd.\n\nThe new Income-tax Bill, 2025 was tabled in Parliament on 13th February 2025, with the objective of overhauling and simplifying the six decades old Income Tax Act, 1961. The Bill was subsequently referred to a Select Committee for detailed examination, and its report is expected to be tabled on the first day of the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament on 21st July 2025. Whereas much debate has surrounded the substitution of the expression \"notwithstanding anything\" with \"irrespective of\" in the New Income-tax Bill, 2025, raising concerns over potential interpretational shifts, the more critical and deliberate yet subtle transformation in the legislative drafting of the faceless regime provisions has largely escaped attention from all quarters. Faceless taxation regime was introduced as a transformative reform in the Indian direct tax landscape, designed to eliminate personal interface, reduce discretion, and bolster transparency. The architecture of faceless assessments, appeals, and penalties, as codified under the Income-tax Act, 1961, especially through the insertion of Section 144B and related provisions, represented a formidable thrust on the legal sanctity of the faceless regime. Successive policy pronouncements from the highest levels of government\u2014most notably the hon'ble Prime Minister and the hon'ble Finance Minister\u2014have celebrated this move as a watershed in ensuring taxpayer rights, institutional neutrality, and administrative efficiency. Yet, the new Income-tax Bill, 2025, which purports to overhaul the direct tax code and bring in clarity and structural reform, curiously retraces this progress.A deeper dive into the Income-tax Bill, 2025, which aims to replace the current Income-tax Act, 1961, reveals a surprising and counterintuitive development: instead of further strengthening the legal foundation and procedural codification of the faceless system, the Bill appears to weaken it. By omitting codified procedures and replacing mandatory faceless mandates with open-ended discretionary future notifications or schemes, the new Bill reflects a retreat from the certainty, structure, and legislative sanctity previously accorded to faceless proceedings. This article critically examines the shift in the legal architecture of faceless assessments, appeals, and penalties under the new Income Tax Bill, and highlights how this transformation, if enacted, would mark a significant departure from the intent and spirit of the faceless regime. I. Faceless Assessments: From Codified Process to Prescribed Procedure To understand the seeminglylegislative dilution of the faceless assessment regime in the new Income-tax Bill, 2025, it is essential to trace the evolution of the same\u2014from its origins as a notified Scheme to its formal codification in section 144B of the Income-tax Act, 1961. With the launch of the \"Honouring the Honest\" platform on 13 August 2020, the CBDT notified the Faceless Assessment Scheme, 2019, bringing in all regular assessments and reassessments proceedings (excluding those under the Central and international tax charge) under the faceless regime. This change was formalised via CBDT Notification No. S.O. 2745(E) dated 13.8.2020, which amended the earlier scheme and mandated that all e-assessments be conducted in a faceless manner. Concerns about the legal validity of such a far-reaching change via delegated legislation led to the insertion of section 144B in the Income-tax Act, 1961, via the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Act, 2020, effective 1 April 2021. This legislative codification of the faceless assessment scheme in a specific section in the Income Tax Act, gave statutory backing and binding legal sanctity to the detailed procedures, definitions, electronic communication protocols, and mechanisms for seeking personal hearings via video conferencing, in the faceless assessment proceedings. Section 144B comprehensively outlined the step-by-step process for faceless assessments, from automated case allocation to communication, response handling, technical review, draft and final order issuance, and eventual jurisdictional transfer. This codification was not merely administrative\u2014it accorded a statutory right to procedural fairness for taxpayers and legally restrained the assessment machinery from arbitrary conduct. Section 273 of the Income-tax Bill, 2025: A Regressive Shift In stark contrast, Clause 273 of the new Income Tax Bill, 2025 which deals with faceless assessments, merely states: \"273(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provisions of this Act, the assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 270(10) or 271 or 279 , as the case may be, with respect to the cases referred to in sub-section (2), shall be made in a faceless manner as per such procedure, as prescribed in this behalf.\" Thus, unlike subsections (1) and (6) of existing section 144B of the existing Act, the new clause 273 in the new Bill, does not contain any of the operational safeguards or procedural codifications. It omits critical provisions relating to: \u2022 Well defined legislative framework of the procedure for the conduct of faceless assessments, \u2022 E-authentication and electronic delivery of communications, \u2022 Right to personal hearing through video conferencing, \u2022 Procedural checks through automated allocation and review mechanisms, \u2022 Standards and protocols for ensuring procedural fairness. In effect, the detailed and legislatively codified framework governing faceless assessments has now been decodified and replaced with an open-ended provision, delegating all procedural aspects to future notifications and rules. This represents a fundamental retreat from the legislative discipline embedded in Section 144B of the existing Act. The entire machinery of checks, balances, and procedural mandates has been delegated to subordinate legislation, to be determined by rules or notifications at a future date. This apparently innocuous line carries significant implications: a. Procedural Discretion: The detailed procedure previously mandated for the conduct of faceless assessments under the Act itself, will now be left to the subordination and delegated legislation. This reduces the legal sanctity of the process and reintroduces discretion in a scheme that was designed to eliminate it. b. Lack of Legislative Oversight: By omitting the detailed procedure from the statute, Parliament effectively outsources procedural integrity to administrative notifications and rules, thereby diluting legislative accountability. c. Reversion to Scheme-based Notifications: This change signals a return to the pre-144B era, where faceless assessments were governed by CBDT schemes, which could be amended or withdrawn without parliamentary approval. The faceless assessment regime, having graduated to statutory legitimacy, is now demoted back to the domain of administrative schemes and CBDT circulars, which lack the force of law and are susceptible to unilateral change. d. Legal Vulnerability: The codification of Section 144B was not merely procedural \u2014 it was judicially tested and became an enforceable right for taxpayers. Replacing it with delegated legislation weakens legal remedies in case of procedural lapses by the department. In effect, what was once a statutory right has now become an administrative expectation.The proposed legislation, instead of codifying and reinforcing the faceless regime, dismantles its legislative framework, reverting back to a discretionary model. This backward shift signals a regression, moving away from codified statutory safeguards and back towards a framework driven by future notifications. It is difficult to decipher the true intent behind such an omission of critical procedural safeguards\u2014especially those codified in sub-sections (1) and (6) of section 144B and the statutory right to a virtual personal hearing\u2014in the new section 273. Whether this is a mere attempt to reduce the word count of the bare provision and shift operational details to a future scheme or notification, or a conscious move to dilute the growing body of judicial rulings from High Courts across India that have struck down faceless assessment orders for non-compliance with section 144B, remains a matter of concern. II. FacelessAppeals: Silent Omission of Subsection (6B) of Section 250 of the existing Income Tax Act The subsection (6B) of section 250 of the existing Income Tax Act was inserted as an enabling clause in the Legislature, to render statutory recognition and the binding legal sanctity to the Faceless Appeal Scheme, for the conduct of appellate proceedings before the CIT(Appeals) in a faceless manner. Section 359 of the New Bill: Absence of Mandatory Faceless Adjudication The new Bill's Section 359, which deals with appellate procedures, is conspicuously silent on the manner of conduct of appeals\u2014there is no mandate to conduct these in a faceless manner. Instead, the entire discretion is left to the general provision under clause 532 , which provides: \"The Central Government may, by notification, make a scheme for\u2026\u2026.\" The substitution of a specific, mandatory direction with a general, permissive clause is not merely a stylistic change\u2014it has far-reaching implications: \u2022 The erstwhile mandatory nature of faceless appeals is diluted. \u2022 The taxpayer now faces uncertainty regarding whether the appeal will be assigned to a faceless unit or a jurisdictional authority. \u2022 The absence of codified processes opens the door to subjectivity and variability in appellate conduct. III. Faceless Reassessments: Omission of Section 151A: A Void in Reassessment Mechanism Recognising the controversy and potential for misuse in reassessment proceedings, section 151A was inserted in the existing Income Tax Act, to ensure that the sacrosanct window of reassessment proceedings, isalso subject to faceless protocol. Conspicuously, the new Bill does not contain any specific pari-materia clause akin to the existing section 151A of the existing Income Tax Act. It only contains a residual and open-ended clause 532, offering CBDT a discretionary hand, rather than imposing a legislative obligation as mandated in section 151A of the existing Act. Legal Jurisprudence in Flux: Legal Implications of Omission of Section 151A The conspicuous omission of a specific mandate akin to Section 151A of the Income-tax Act, 1961, in the proposed Income-tax Bill, 2025, assumes added significance in light of the rapidly evolving judicial discourse on the faceless regime, particularly in the context of reassessment proceedings. Section 151A currently provides a clear statutory command that both the issuance of notice under Section 148 and the conduct of the entire reassessment proceedings must be undertaken in a faceless manner. This has led to a series of legal challenges, where assessees have questioned the jurisdiction of local Assessing Officers (AOs) to issue reassessment notices in violation of the mandate that such actions be taken by the designated faceless assessment units. A plethora of litigations\u2014where the issuance of reopening notice by a jurisdictional AO instead of the faceless unit has been challenged\u2014is now pending adjudication before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In this backdrop, the absence of a counterpart to Section 151A in the new legislation, and the insertion instead of a vague, discretionary enabling clause in Section 532, appears to be more than inadvertent. It is arguably a deliberate legislative choice, designed to circumvent judicial scrutiny by removing the statutory mandates that are presently being interpreted and enforced by courts. Such an approach risks not only nullifying emerging jurisprudence but also creates a legislative vacuum where procedural safeguards are subject entirely to administrative fiat. This shift may shield future proceedings from procedural challenges but does so at the cost of legal certainty, transparency, and the rule of law and the core values which the faceless regime was intended to institutionalize.While, the new Bill does introduce a revised reassessment framework, it fails to incorporate the faceless mandate previously codified. IV. Faceless Penalty Proceedings: Vanishing Mandate of Section 274(2A) The subsection (2A) of section 274 of the existing Income Tax Act was inserted as an enabling clause in the Legislature, to render statutory recognition and the binding legal sanctity to the Faceless Penalty Scheme, for the conduct of penalty proceedings in a faceless manner. Absence of Faceless Mandate in New Bill In the Income-tax Bill, 2025, the provisions relating to penalties (particularly clause 471 onward) do not contain any analogous clause. There is no legislative requirement for penalty proceedings to be conducted in a faceless manner. The omission is particularly alarming given the subjective nature of penalty imposition and the need for insulation from personal biases. Once again, the safeguard is diluted, and taxpayers are left at the mercy of Board notifications that may or may not implement faceless processes. V. Section 532: The Catch-All Clause in New Bill that Undermines Specific Mandates Clause 532 is a general enabling provision in the new Income Tax Bill, intended to empower the Central Government to extend faceless functioning to any provision or process. However, its phrasing\u2014 \"may... make a scheme\" \u2014is purely discretionary and lacks the mandatory character of earlier provisions. Therefore, critically: \u2022 Section 532 lacks any procedural contours or minimum standards. \u2022 It operates in administrative vacuum, without guarantee of implementation timelines or uniformity. \u2022 It introduces ambiguity into core processes that were previously clear and enforceable under the statute. The move from existing mandatory statutory legislative provisions to discretionary administrative powers represents a dilution of the faceless regime reform, both in spirit and in substance. VI. Dissonance Between Policy Pronouncements and Legislative Drafting The dilution of the faceless regime in the Income-tax Bill, 2025, is particularly perplexing when juxtaposed against public statements by government leadership.The Hon'ble Prime Minister and Finance Minister have consistently upheld faceless tax administration as a flagship reform, aimed at eradicating corruption, building trust, and ushering in a technology-driven tax ecosystem. However, the legislative drafting in the new Bill fails to reflect this vision. Instead of deepening and strengthening the faceless regime, it subverts the very legislative scaffolding that enabled it to function impartially and efficiently. VII Recommendations and Way Forward To preserve the gains of the faceless regime and ensure that they are not diluted in the transition to the new law, the following corrective measures are recommended: a. Codify Key Procedural Safeguards: At the very least, essential steps \u2014 like draft notices, response timelines, automated allocation, prohibition on physical interface \u2014 should be embedded in the statute itself. b. Retain Mandatory Language: The words \"shall be conducted in a faceless manner\" should be restored in provisions dealing with assessments, appeals, reassessments, and penalties. c. Avoid Over-Reliance on Board Notifications: While administrative flexibility is important, core processes must remain under legislative control to ensure taxpayer rights are protected. d. Ensure Uniform Application: The faceless regime should not be left to sectoral or geographic variation based on Board discretion. A nationwide standard must be maintained. e. Subject Rule-Making to Parliamentary Scrutiny: Rules issued under Section 532 should be laid before Parliament to maintain democratic oversight. VIII. Conclusion: Reform Requires Reinforcement, Not Retreat As India stands at the cusp of overhauling its direct tax law after more than six decades, the Income-tax Bill, 2025 offers a historic opportunity to reimagine and reinforce administrative mechanisms. However, in the case of faceless adjudication, the Bill has regrettably opted for retreat over reinforcement. The systematic dismantling of statutory safeguards and codified processes under the guise of simplification and delegation is not mere legislative housekeeping\u2014it has the potential to erode hard-won taxpayer protections and disrupt the very trust the faceless system was designed to cultivate. Unless these provisions are revisited and re-codified with legislative clarity, consistency, and compulsion, the faceless regime risks becoming an optional tool rather than a constitutional commitment. The faceless system was never about anonymity alone\u2014it was about accountability through system-driven governance. That ideal deserves not just policy applause, but statutory permanence. \u25a0\u25a0 \u00a9 Copyright Taxmann.

S M Mohanka & Associates & Founder Director in Tax Aaram India Pvt. Ltd.\nThe new Income-tax Bill, 2025 was tabled in Parliament on 13th February 2025, with the objective of overhauling and simplifying the six decades old Income Tax Act, 1961. The Bill was subsequently referred to a Select Committee for detailed examination, and its report is expected to be tabled on the first day of the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament on 21st July 2025.Whereas much debate has surrounded the substitution of the expression \"notwithstanding anything\" with \"irrespective of\" in the New Income-tax Bill, 2025, raising concerns over potential interpretational shifts, the more critical and deliberate yet subtle transformation in the legislative drafting of the faceless regime provisions has largely escaped attention from all quarters.Faceless taxation regime was introduced as a transformative reform in the Indian direct tax landscape, designed to eliminate personal interface, reduce discretion, and bolster transparency. The architecture of faceless assessments, appeals, and penalties, as codified under the Income-tax Act, 1961, especially through the insertion of Section144Band related provisions, represented a formidable thrust on the legal sanctity of the faceless regime.Successive policy pronouncements from the highest levels of government\u2014most notably the hon'ble Prime Minister and the hon'ble Finance Minister\u2014have celebrated this move as a watershed in ensuring taxpayer rights, institutional neutrality, and administrative efficiency.Yet, the new Income-tax Bill, 2025, which purports to overhaul the direct tax code and bring in clarity and structural reform, curiously retraces this progress.A deeper dive into the Income-tax Bill, 2025, which aims to replace the current Income-tax Act, 1961, reveals a surprising and counterintuitive development: instead of further strengthening the legal foundation and procedural codification of the faceless system, the Bill appears to weaken it.By omitting codified procedures and replacing mandatory faceless mandates with open-ended discretionary future notifications or schemes, the new Bill reflects a retreat from the certainty, structure, and legislative sanctity previously accorded to faceless proceedings.This article critically examines the shift in the legal architecture of faceless assessments, appeals, and penalties under the new Income Tax Bill, and highlights how this transformation, if enacted, would mark a significant departure from the intent and spirit of the faceless regime.I. Faceless Assessments: From Codified Process to Prescribed ProcedureTo understand the seeminglylegislative dilution of the faceless assessment regime in the new Income-tax Bill, 2025, it is essential to trace the evolution of the same\u2014from its origins as a notified Scheme to its formal codification in section 144B of the Income-tax Act, 1961.With the launch of the \"Honouring the Honest\" platform on 13 August 2020, the CBDT notified the Faceless Assessment Scheme, 2019, bringing in all regular assessments and reassessments proceedings (excluding those under the Central and international tax charge) under the faceless regime.This change was formalised via CBDT Notification No. S.O. 2745(E) dated 13.8.2020, which amended the earlier scheme and mandated that all e-assessments be conducted in a faceless manner.Concerns about the legal validity of such a far-reaching change via delegated legislation led to theinsertion of section 144Bin the Income-tax Act, 1961, via the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Act, 2020, effective 1 April 2021.This legislative codification of the faceless assessment scheme in a specific section in the Income Tax Act, gave statutory backing and binding legal sanctity to the detailed procedures, definitions, electronic communication protocols, and mechanisms for seeking personal hearings via video conferencing, in the faceless assessment proceedings.Section 144B comprehensively outlined the step-by-step process for faceless assessments, from automated case allocation to communication, response handling, technical review, draft and final order issuance, and eventual jurisdictional transfer.This codification was not merely administrative\u2014it accorded a statutory right to procedural fairness for taxpayers and legally restrained the assessment machinery from arbitrary conduct.Section273of the Income-tax Bill, 2025: A Regressive ShiftIn stark contrast, Clause 273 of the new Income Tax Bill, 2025 which deals with faceless assessments, merely states:\"273(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provisions of this Act, the assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section270(10)or271or279, as the case may be, with respect to the cases referred to in sub-section (2),shall be made in a faceless manner as per such procedure, as prescribed in this behalf.\"Thus, unlike subsections (1) and (6) of existing section 144B of the existing Act, the new clause 273 in the new Bill, does not contain any of the operational safeguards or procedural codifications. It omits critical provisions relating to:\u2022Well defined legislative framework of the procedure for the conduct of faceless assessments,\u2022E-authentication and electronic delivery of communications,\u2022Right to personal hearing through video conferencing,\u2022Procedural checks through automated allocation and review mechanisms,\u2022Standards and protocols for ensuring procedural fairness.In effect, the detailed and legislatively codified framework governing faceless assessments has now been decodified and replaced with an open-ended provision, delegating all procedural aspects to future notifications and rules.This represents a fundamental retreat from the legislative discipline embedded in Section 144B of the existing Act. The entire machinery of checks, balances, and procedural mandates has been delegated to subordinate legislation, to be determined by rules or notifications at a future date.This apparently innocuous line carries significant implications:a.Procedural Discretion:The detailed procedure previously mandated for the conduct of faceless assessments under the Act itself, will now be left to the subordination and delegated legislation. This reduces the legal sanctity of the process and reintroduces discretion in a scheme that was designed to eliminate it.b.Lack of Legislative Oversight:By omitting the detailed procedure from the statute, Parliament effectively outsources procedural integrity to administrative notifications and rules, thereby diluting legislative accountability.c.Reversion to Scheme-based Notifications:This change signals a return to the pre-144B era, where faceless assessments were governed by CBDT schemes, which could be amended or withdrawn without parliamentary approval. The faceless assessment regime, having graduated to statutory legitimacy, is now demoted back to the domain of administrative schemes and CBDT circulars, which lack the force of law and are susceptible to unilateral change.d.Legal Vulnerability:The codification of Section 144B was not merely procedural \u2014 it was judicially tested and became an enforceable right for taxpayers. Replacing it with delegated legislation weakens legal remedies in case of procedural lapses by the department.In effect, what was once a statutory right has now become an administrative expectation.The proposed legislation, instead of codifying and reinforcing the faceless regime, dismantles its legislative framework, reverting back to a discretionary model. This backward shift signals a regression, moving away from codified statutory safeguards and back towards a framework driven by future notifications.It is difficult to decipher the true intent behind such an omission of critical procedural safeguards\u2014especially those codified in sub-sections (1) and (6) of section 144B and the statutory right to a virtual personal hearing\u2014in the new section 273. Whether this is a mere attempt to reduce the word count of the bare provision and shift operational details to a future scheme or notification, or a conscious move to dilute the growing body of judicial rulings from High Courts across India that have struck down faceless assessment orders for non-compliance with section 144B, remains a matter of concern.II. FacelessAppeals: Silent Omission of Subsection (6B) of Section 250 of the existing Income Tax ActThe subsection (6B) of section250of the existing Income Tax Act was inserted as an enabling clause in the Legislature, to render statutory recognition and the binding legal sanctity to the Faceless Appeal Scheme, for the conduct of appellate proceedings before the CIT(Appeals) in a faceless manner.Section 359 of the New Bill: Absence of Mandatory Faceless AdjudicationThe new Bill's Section 359, which deals with appellate procedures, is conspicuously silent on the manner of conduct of appeals\u2014there is no mandate to conduct these in a faceless manner. Instead, the entire discretion is left to the general provisionunder clause 532, which provides:\"The Central Government may, by notification, make a scheme for\u2026\u2026.\"The substitution of a specific, mandatory direction with a general, permissive clause is not merely a stylistic change\u2014it has far-reaching implications:\u2022The erstwhile mandatory nature of faceless appeals is diluted.\u2022The taxpayer now faces uncertainty regarding whether the appeal will be assigned to a faceless unit or a jurisdictional authority.\u2022The absence of codified processes opens the door to subjectivity and variability in appellate conduct.III. Faceless Reassessments: Omission of Section 151A: A Void in Reassessment MechanismRecognising the controversy and potential for misuse in reassessment proceedings, section 151A was inserted in the existing Income Tax Act, to ensure that the sacrosanct window of reassessment proceedings, isalso subject to faceless protocol.Conspicuously, the new Bill does not contain any specific pari-materia clause akin to the existing section 151A of the existing Income Tax Act. It only contains a residual and open-ended clause 532, offering CBDT a discretionary hand, rather than imposing a legislative obligation as mandated in section 151A of the existing Act.Legal Jurisprudence in Flux: Legal Implications of Omission of Section 151AThe conspicuous omission of a specific mandate akin to Section 151A of the Income-tax Act, 1961, in the proposed Income-tax Bill, 2025, assumes added significance in light of the rapidly evolving judicial discourse on the faceless regime, particularly in the context of reassessment proceedings. Section 151A currently provides a clear statutory command that both the issuance of notice under Section 148 and the conduct of the entire reassessment proceedings must be undertaken in a faceless manner. This has led to a series of legal challenges, where assessees have questioned the jurisdiction of local Assessing Officers (AOs) to issue reassessment notices in violation of the mandate that such actions be taken by the designated faceless assessment units. A plethora of litigations\u2014where the issuance of reopening notice by a jurisdictional AO instead of the faceless unit has been challenged\u2014is now pending adjudication before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.In this backdrop, the absence of a counterpart to Section151Ain the new legislation, and the insertion instead of a vague, discretionary enabling clause in Section 532, appears to be more than inadvertent. It is arguably a deliberate legislative choice, designed to circumvent judicial scrutiny by removing the statutory mandates that are presently being interpreted and enforced by courts. Such an approach risks not only nullifying emerging jurisprudence but also creates a legislative vacuum where procedural safeguards are subject entirely to administrative fiat.This shift may shield future proceedings from procedural challenges but does so at the cost of legal certainty, transparency, and the rule of law and the core values which the faceless regime was intended to institutionalize.While, the new Bill does introduce a revised reassessment framework, it fails to incorporate the faceless mandate previously codified.IV. Faceless Penalty Proceedings: Vanishing Mandate of Section 274(2A)The subsection (2A) of section 274 of the existing Income Tax Act was inserted as an enabling clause in the Legislature, to render statutory recognition and the binding legal sanctity to the Faceless Penalty Scheme, for the conduct of penalty proceedings in a faceless manner.Absence of Faceless Mandate in New BillIn the Income-tax Bill, 2025, the provisions relating to penalties (particularlyclause 471onward) do not contain any analogous clause. There is no legislative requirement for penalty proceedings to be conducted in a faceless manner.The omission is particularly alarming given the subjective nature of penalty imposition and the need for insulation from personal biases. Once again, the safeguard is diluted, and taxpayers are left at the mercy of Board notifications that may or may not implement faceless processes.V. Section 532: The Catch-All Clause in New Bill that Undermines Specific MandatesClause 532 is a general enabling provision in the new Income Tax Bill, intended to empower the Central Government to extend faceless functioning to any provision or process. However, its phrasing\u2014\"may... make a scheme\"\u2014is purely discretionary and lacks the mandatory character of earlier provisions.Therefore, critically:\u2022Section 532 lacks any procedural contours or minimum standards.\u2022It operates in administrative vacuum, without guarantee of implementation timelines or uniformity.\u2022It introduces ambiguity into core processes that were previously clear and enforceable under the statute.The move from existing mandatory statutory legislative provisions to discretionary administrative powers represents a dilution of the faceless regime reform, both in spirit and in substance.VI. Dissonance Between Policy Pronouncements and Legislative DraftingThe dilution of the faceless regime in the Income-tax Bill, 2025, is particularly perplexing when juxtaposed against public statements by government leadership.The Hon'ble Prime Minister and Finance Minister have consistently upheld faceless tax administration as a flagship reform, aimed at eradicating corruption, building trust, and ushering in a technology-driven tax ecosystem.However, the legislative drafting in the new Bill fails to reflect this vision. Instead of deepening and strengthening the faceless regime, it subverts the very legislative scaffolding that enabled it to function impartially and efficiently.VII Recommendations and Way ForwardTo preserve the gains of the faceless regime and ensure that they are not diluted in the transition to the new law, the following corrective measures are recommended:a.Codify Key Procedural Safeguards:At the very least, essential steps \u2014 like draft notices, response timelines, automated allocation, prohibition on physical interface \u2014 should be embedded in the statute itself.b.Retain Mandatory Language:The words \"shall be conducted in a faceless manner\" should be restored in provisions dealing with assessments, appeals, reassessments, and penalties.c.Avoid Over-Reliance on Board Notifications:While administrative flexibility is important, core processes must remain under legislative control to ensure taxpayer rights are protected.d.Ensure Uniform Application:The faceless regime should not be left to sectoral or geographic variation based on Board discretion. A nationwide standard must be maintained.e.Subject Rule-Making to Parliamentary Scrutiny:Rules issued under Section 532 should be laid before Parliament to maintain democratic oversight.VIII. Conclusion: Reform Requires Reinforcement, Not RetreatAs India stands at the cusp of overhauling its direct tax law after more than six decades, the Income-tax Bill, 2025 offers a historic opportunity to reimagine and reinforce administrative mechanisms. However, in the case of faceless adjudication, the Bill has regrettably opted for retreat over reinforcement.The systematic dismantling of statutory safeguards and codified processes under the guise of simplification and delegation is not mere legislative housekeeping\u2014it has the potential to erode hard-won taxpayer protections and disrupt the very trust the faceless system was designed to cultivate.Unless these provisions are revisited and re-codified with legislative clarity, consistency, and compulsion, the faceless regime risks becoming an optional tool rather than a constitutional commitment.The faceless system was never about anonymity alone\u2014it was about accountability through system-driven governance. That ideal deserves not just policy applause, but statutory permanence.\u25a0\u25a0\u00a9Copyright Taxmann.

Introduction: The main reason for enacting the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is to tackle the problem of non-performing assets and promote corporate insolvency in India. The main objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is to resolve promptly and on time, protect the time value of money, maximise the value of assets of the corporate debtor, and to keep the business as a going concern. By doing this, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code maintains the interests of all the creditors, debtors and employees and also promotes entrepreneurship and easy credit availability in the economy. The IBC code has played a prominent role in the insolvency framework in India. And the code has removed the fragmented approaches in insolvency and has made a unified approach that prioritises the resolution over liquidation, and to protect the main objective of keeping the business as a going concern. Despite the intention of the code, as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) reports, as of March 31 st , 2025, out of 8308 admitted cases, only 1194 (14.37%) cases have been resolved, and 2758(33.19%) have been liquidated. So, it clearly shows that most of the cases have ended in liquidation rather than resolution. So this difference raises the question of the factors influencing the liquidation over the resolution. The reasons for liquidation range from a delay in the commencement of CIRP to a lack of proper resolution plans. This paper explains the factors influencing the liquidation of resolutions with relevant case studies and also provides recommendations that promote resolution under the code. 2. EXPLORING THE FACTORS DRIVING LIQUIDATION: 2.1 Reduction of economic value before admission: The main reason for liquidation over resolution is the loss of economic value of a company's assets. Before the company enters the CIRP process, the assets of the company have deteriorated, and by the time of acting under the IBC, the value of the company will be almost diminished, so it doesn't seem viable under the resolution, and it fails to attract good resolution applicants 1 . The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has stated that the main reason for liquidation, the company is already suffering a liquidity crunch, with lots of debts and a poor market value, with little space for resolution. By the time it enters the CIRP process, it not only loses its economic value to the company but also affects the confidence of the resolution applicants, who may feel the company is a high-risk investment. In the case of Swiss Ribbons Pvt Ltd . v. Union of India 2 , the Supreme Court has stated that the main intention of the IBC is not only the recovery mechanism, but also to revive the business and to keep the company as a going concern. And it also highlighted that when the company is already eroded, then the only possibility is to maximize the value of the assets and enter into liquidation. Because it aligns with the intention of the IBC, in this situation, the only possibility is liquidation. To tackle this issue, it is necessary to identify the distressed companies in the early stages, And timely admission of companies into CIRP. So, it helps in preserving the value of the assets in the company and increases the chances of resolution. 2.2. High Bankruptcy Costs: Another factor influencing liquidation over resolution in CIRP is high bankruptcy costs. After initiating the CIRP, various expenses are incurred, including fees for resolution professionals, legal professionals, Registered valuers, auditors and other administrative expenses. All these costs consume a large part of the corporate debtor and leave little for the creditors. So, these cases are unattractive to the resolution applicants, especially where the company is almost dead 3 . In the case of the committee of creditors of Essar Steel India v. Satish Kumar Gupta , 4 , it was stated that the expenses incurred in the CIRP process should be reduced to preserve the value for creditors. And the court emphasised that the main objective of the code is to maximise the value of assets and ensure a timely resolution. 2.3. Lack of Viable Resolution Plans: One of the significant factors for liquidation over resolution is the lack of feasible resolution plans. And the resolution applicants refrain from submitting a resolution plan due to the presence of distressed assets and the complexities involved in the restructuring of distressed assets. The problem is further complicated by the minimal time available to the prospective resolution applicants to perform due diligence. The code mandates the stringent timelines for the submission of resolution applications, leaving less space for the resolution applicants to find out the financial and operational viability of the company. 5 As a result, resolution plans fail to follow the code, which results in rejection by the committee of creditors and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). This finally leads the company towards liquidation. In the case of Arcelor Mittal India Pvt. Ltd . v. Satisha Kumar Gupta [2018] 6 . The case arose when Arcelor Mittal submitted a resolution application for Essar Steel Ltd. Still, the committee of creditors rejected it for non-compliance with Section 29A of the court. The Supreme Court emphasized that, even though the objective of the code is to revive the business and to keep the company as a going concern, the plans should not deviate from the legal framework of the code. To address this issue, sufficient time is to be provided to the resolution applicants to conduct the due diligence. 2.4. Delay in Initiation of CIRP: The lapse in filing of CIRP by creditors and debtors often results in the significant loss of asset value of the corporate debtor. Because of the delay in the filing of the bankruptcy applications, it not only worsens the financial health of the business but also leaves less space for the resolution applicants to work with. This delay reduces the chances of revival and also increases the probability of liquidation. 7 The code mandates the completion of timely resolution within 330 days, so it causes immense pressure on the NCLT to stick to this timeline. So, if there is a delay in the filing of CIRP or its approval by the adjudicating authority, it may lead to liquidation. Ironically, it's a process designed for timely resolution, inadvertently leads to the liquidation due to operational delays and procedural delays. In the case of Innoventive Industries Ltd. v. ICICI Bank [2017] 8 . The Supreme Court emphasisied the importance of the timely initiation of insolvency applications to protect the value of the corporate debtor's assets. The delay in the filing of applications deteriorates the value of assets of corporate debtors, and liquidation will be the only possible outcome. 2.5. Sectoral Challenges: Few sectors, such as real estate and infrastructure projects, face unique challenges due to the long-term nature of projects and high capital requirements, making resolution unfeasible. In the recent case liquidation of Amrapali Group companies, the issues of financial mismanagement and regulatory non-compliance were highlighted. 9 The presence of complexities in large scale housing projects combined with the interest of homebuyers, further complicates the issue, leaving liquidation as the only viable option. 10 To enhance the resolution in these areas, there is a need for sector-specific frameworks and regulatory support. The tailored reforms attract the resolution applicants and improve the chances of resolution over liquidation. 3. Recommendations: To achieve more effective outcomes in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), several changes need to be implemented. such as early identification of distressed assets through mechanisms that regularly monitor the financial health of the company, along with early warning systems to facilitate timely admission of CIRPs, which helps in preventing the erosion of asset value. 11 Additionally, prepackaged insolvency resolution should be encouraged to enable debtors and creditors to negotiate and finalize resolution plans, thereby reducing procedural delays. Financial incentives and tax benefits should be introduced for those willing to invest in distressed assets. The role of the Committee of creditors must be strengthened by ensuring structured training programs, which help in balanced decision-making during the resolution. Sector-specific policies are necessary for industries like real estate and infrastructure, where tailored regulatory mechanisms ensure timely resolution. Increasing the capacity of the National Company Law tribunals, such as the introduction of fast-track mechanisms for approving resolution plans, helps in reducing procedural delays. Encouraging the participation of asset reconstruction companies in CIRP can significantly aid in restructuring distressed assets. Additionally, providing sufficient time and comprehensive information about the corporate debtor improves transparency and increases the chances of resolution over liquidation. 4. Conclusion: The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is the major reform aimed at strengthening the corporate insolvency resolution process. The main objective of the code is to prioritise resolution over liquidation, preserving the value of assets and ensuring that the business as a going concern. Despite the intended purpose of the code, as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), reveals major number of cases ended in liquidation. As of March 31 st, 2025, only 14.37% of admitted cases resulted in resolution, while 33.19% ended in liquidation. This stark highlights the importance of the factors influencing liquidation over resolution. The key challenges hindering effective resolution include high bankruptcy costs, delay in initiation of CIRP, Lack of viable resolution plans, sectoral challenges and reduction of economic value before admission. All these major factors not only diminish the financial viability of the corporate debtor and leave a limited potential for revival, making liquidation the default outcome. Industries like infrastructure and real estate suffer unique challenges, such as regulatory hurdles and high capital requirements, which complicate the resolution outcomes. To address these challenges, early identification of distressed assets, offering tax benefits to the resolution applicants, streamlining the resolution process, enhancing the capacity of NCLT benches, implementing sector-specific frameworks and encouraging the participation of Asset reconstruction companies. Although IBC has made significant progress, ongoing reforms are necessary to achieve its objectives. By tackling challenges and addressing effective reforms, enhance the resolution process, preserve the asset value and contribute to the overall economic growth of India.

Introduction:The main reason for enacting the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is to tackle the problem of non-performing assets and promote corporate insolvency in India. The main objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is to resolve promptly and on time, protect the time value of money, maximise the value of assets of the corporate debtor, and to keep the business as a going concern. By doing this, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code maintains the interests of all the creditors, debtors and employees and also promotes entrepreneurship and easy credit availability in the economy.The IBC code has played a prominent role in the insolvency framework in India. And the code has removed the fragmented approaches in insolvency and has made a unified approach that prioritises the resolution over liquidation, and to protect the main objective of keeping the business as a going concern. Despite the intention of the code, as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) reports, as of March 31st, 2025, out of 8308 admitted cases, only 1194 (14.37%) cases have been resolved, and 2758(33.19%) have been liquidated. So, it clearly shows that most of the cases have ended in liquidation rather than resolution. So this difference raises the question of the factors influencing the liquidation over the resolution.The reasons for liquidation range from a delay in the commencement of CIRP to a lack of proper resolution plans. This paper explains the factors influencing the liquidation of resolutions with relevant case studies and also provides recommendations that promote resolution under the code.2. EXPLORING THE FACTORS DRIVING LIQUIDATION:2.1 Reduction of economic value before admission:The main reason for liquidation over resolution is the loss of economic value of a company's assets. Before the company enters the CIRP process, the assets of the company have deteriorated, and by the time of acting under the IBC, the value of the company will be almost diminished, so it doesn't seem viable under the resolution, and it fails to attract good resolution applicants1.The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has stated that the main reason for liquidation, the company is already suffering a liquidity crunch, with lots of debts and a poor market value, with little space for resolution. By the time it enters the CIRP process, it not only loses its economic value to the company but also affects the confidence of the resolution applicants, who may feel the company is a high-risk investment.In the case ofSwiss Ribbons Pvt Ltd. v.Union of India2, the Supreme Court has stated that the main intention of the IBC is not only the recovery mechanism, but also to revive the business and to keep the company as a going concern. And it also highlighted that when the company is already eroded, then the only possibility is to maximize the value of the assets and enter into liquidation. Because it aligns with the intention of the IBC, in this situation, the only possibility is liquidation.To tackle this issue, it is necessary to identify the distressed companies in the early stages,And timely admission of companies into CIRP. So, it helps in preserving the value of the assets in the company and increases the chances of resolution.2.2. High Bankruptcy Costs:Another factor influencing liquidation over resolution in CIRP is high bankruptcy costs. After initiating the CIRP, various expenses are incurred, including fees for resolution professionals, legal professionals, Registered valuers, auditors and other administrative expenses. All these costs consume a large part of the corporate debtor and leave little for the creditors. So, these cases are unattractive to the resolution applicants, especially where the company is almost dead3.In the case of the committee of creditors ofEssar Steel Indiav.Satish Kumar Gupta,4, it was stated that the expenses incurred in the CIRP process should be reduced to preserve the value for creditors. And the court emphasised that the main objective of the code is to maximise the value of assets and ensure a timely resolution.2.3. Lack of Viable Resolution Plans:One of the significant factors for liquidation over resolution is the lack of feasible resolution plans. And the resolution applicants refrain from submitting a resolution plan due to the presence of distressed assets and the complexities involved in the restructuring of distressed assets.The problem is further complicated by the minimal time available to the prospective resolution applicants to perform due diligence. The code mandates the stringent timelines for the submission of resolution applications, leaving less space for the resolution applicants to find out the financial and operational viability of the company.5As a result, resolution plans fail to follow the code, which results in rejection by the committee of creditors and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). This finally leads the company towards liquidation.In the case ofArcelor Mittal India Pvt. Ltd. v.Satisha Kumar Gupta[2018]6. The case arose when Arcelor Mittal submitted a resolution application for Essar Steel Ltd. Still, the committee of creditors rejected it for non-compliance with Section29Aof the court. The Supreme Court emphasized that, even though the objective of the code is to revive the business and to keep the company as a going concern, the plans should not deviate from the legal framework of the code. To address this issue, sufficient time is to be provided to the resolution applicants to conduct the due diligence.2.4. Delay in Initiation of CIRP:The lapse in filing of CIRP by creditors and debtors often results in the significant loss of asset value of the corporate debtor. Because of the delay in the filing of the bankruptcy applications, it not only worsens the financial health of the business but also leaves less space for the resolution applicants to work with. This delay reduces the chances of revival and also increases the probability of liquidation.7The code mandates the completion of timely resolution within 330 days, so it causes immense pressure on the NCLT to stick to this timeline. So, if there is a delay in the filing of CIRP or its approval by the adjudicating authority, it may lead to liquidation. Ironically, it's a process designed for timely resolution, inadvertently leads to the liquidation due to operational delays and procedural delays.In the case ofInnoventive Industries Ltd.v.ICICI Bank[2017]8. The Supreme Court emphasisied the importance of the timely initiation of insolvency applications to protect the value of the corporate debtor's assets. The delay in the filing of applications deteriorates the value of assets of corporate debtors, and liquidation will be the only possible outcome.2.5. Sectoral Challenges:Few sectors, such as real estate and infrastructure projects, face unique challenges due to the long-term nature of projects and high capital requirements, making resolution unfeasible.In the recent case liquidation of Amrapali Group companies, the issues of financial mismanagement and regulatory non-compliance were highlighted.9The presence of complexities in large scale housing projects combined with the interest of homebuyers, further complicates the issue, leaving liquidation as the only viable option.10To enhance the resolution in these areas, there is a need for sector-specific frameworks and regulatory support. The tailored reforms attract the resolution applicants and improve the chances of resolution over liquidation.3. Recommendations:To achieve more effective outcomes in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), several changes need to be implemented. such as early identification of distressed assets through mechanisms that regularly monitor the financial health of the company, along with early warning systems to facilitate timely admission of CIRPs, which helps in preventing the erosion of asset value.11Additionally, prepackaged insolvency resolution should be encouraged to enable debtors and creditors to negotiate and finalize resolution plans, thereby reducing procedural delays. Financial incentives and tax benefits should be introduced for those willing to invest in distressed assets. The role of the Committee of creditors must be strengthened by ensuring structured training programs, which help in balanced decision-making during the resolution.Sector-specific policies are necessary for industries like real estate and infrastructure, where tailored regulatory mechanisms ensure timely resolution. Increasing the capacity of the National Company Law tribunals, such as the introduction of fast-track mechanisms for approving resolution plans, helps in reducing procedural delays. Encouraging the participation of asset reconstruction companies in CIRP can significantly aid in restructuring distressed assets. Additionally, providing sufficient time and comprehensive information about the corporate debtor improves transparency and increases the chances of resolution over liquidation.4. Conclusion:The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is the major reform aimed at strengthening the corporate insolvency resolution process. The main objective of the code is to prioritise resolution over liquidation, preserving the value of assets and ensuring that the business as a going concern. Despite the intended purpose of the code, as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), reveals major number of cases ended in liquidation. As of March 31st,2025, only 14.37% of admitted cases resulted in resolution, while 33.19% ended in liquidation. This stark highlights the importance of the factors influencing liquidation over resolution.The key challenges hindering effective resolution include high bankruptcy costs, delay in initiation of CIRP, Lack of viable resolution plans, sectoral challenges and reduction of economic value before admission. All these major factors not only diminish the financial viability of the corporate debtor and leave a limited potential for revival, making liquidation the default outcome. Industries like infrastructure and real estate suffer unique challenges, such as regulatory hurdles and high capital requirements, which complicate the resolution outcomes.To address these challenges, early identification of distressed assets, offering tax benefits to the resolution applicants, streamlining the resolution process, enhancing the capacity of NCLT benches, implementing sector-specific frameworks and encouraging the participation of Asset reconstruction companies.Although IBC has made significant progress, ongoing reforms are necessary to achieve its objectives. By tackling challenges and addressing effective reforms, enhance the resolution process, preserve the asset value and contribute to the overall economic growth of India.Bibliography:Abhirami A and Rahul T, 'On the Effectiveness of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Empirical Evidence from India' (2022) 2 Law and Business 20Advisors R, 'Why More Cases Go for Liquidation rather than Resolution under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 Content' [2020] <https://rbsa.in/wp-content / uploads/reports / research-reports / RBSA-Why-more - cases-go-for-Liquidation-01May2020.pdf> accessed 9 July 2025Mittal chitresh, 'INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL of ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH CORPORATE INSOLVENCY RESOLUTION PROCESS (CIRP)' <https://ijalr.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/04 / CORPORATE-INSOLVENCY-RESOLUTION-PROCESS - CIRP-UNDER-IBC-2016-VIS-A-VIS-RESOLUTION-VS.-LIQUIDATION.pdf> accessed 9 July 2025\u25a0\u25a0\u00a9Copyright Taxmann.

Here is a glimpse of the tax happening in the world this week: 1.\tGeorgia introduces tax benefits for innovative Startups, SMEs, and R&D service providers Georgia has enacted the Law on Amendments to the Law on Innovation (No. 718-IIMS-XIMP) and to the Tax Code (No. 719-IIMS-XIMP), introducing tax benefits for three categories: innovative startups, innovative SMEs, and R&D service providers. (a)\tInnovative Startup A Georgian company creating innovative products, processes, or services may qualify if it has secured at least GEL 100,000 in investment or GEL 150,000 in grants within two years prior to applying. The funds must be used for its innovative activities, and the company must be tax-compliant, solvent, and not in liquidation. Status is granted for one year, extendable up to 10 years if conditions are met. Tax incentives: \u2022 Years 1\u20133: Salary income tax exemption within limits. \u2022 Years 4\u20136: Salaries taxed at 5%; profit tax at 5%. \u2022 Years 7\u201310: Salaries taxed at 10%; profit tax at 10%. (b)\tInnovative SME A Georgian SME qualifies if its annual R&D expenses are at least 5% of total revenue (and at least GEL 100,000) and if it holds a patent, uses copyrighted software, or purchases services from recognized research institutions or R&D providers. It must remain tax-compliant and solvent. Status remains valid if requirements are maintained. Tax incentives: \u2022 When paying dividends, profit tax base may be reduced by three times the previous year's R&D costs. \u2022 Eligible for reinvestment support per government rules. (c)\tR&D Service Provider Company A Georgian company mainly engaged in research and development (Code 72.1) with at least 80% of income from that activity may qualify if it remains tax-compliant and solvent. Status is indefinite if conditions persist. Tax incentives: \u2022 Salaries taxed at 5%; profit tax rate is 5%. The new rules take effect on 27 September 2025.

Amount B is designed to offer a standardized and streamlined method for pricing specific controlled transactions involving routine marketing and distribution functions. Jurisdictions may choose to adopt Amount B for transactions involving distributors, sales agents, and brokers for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2025. The FAQs clarify that Japan will not implement the Amount B simplified approach at this stage. Key clarifications provided include: \u2022 In cases where foreign related entities (such as subsidiaries) are located in jurisdictions applying the simplified approach to determine the arm's length price, Japan will still require the use of standard (conventional) transfer pricing methods. \u2022 As Japan has not adopted the simplified approach, Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) applications involving related parties in jurisdictions applying Amount B must be based on standard arm's length pricing methods. \u2022 Where double taxation arises in jurisdictions applying the simplified approach, Mutual Agreement Procedures (MAP) may be initiated under an applicable tax treaty. These procedures will be based on standard transfer pricing methods. However, Japan may give due consideration to the outcomes of the simplified approach, provided this is consistent with domestic law and administrative practices and in accordance with Amount B guidance. \u2022 Transfer pricing documentation based solely on the simplified approach will generally not meet Japan's documentation requirements. Nevertheless, such documentation may be accepted if it also includes an analysis using standard arm's length pricing methods and the outcomes align with those under the simplified approach.

A key feature is the introduction of the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax (DPPT) under the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act 2025. Under this, any foreign vendor with a significant digital presence in Pakistan must pay DPPT at 5% on proceeds from all supplies of digitally ordered goods or services made from outside Pakistan, whether delivered digitally or physically. A significant digital presence exists if the vendor's supplies exceed PKR 1 million in a financial year and any of these conditions apply: \u2022 user base and related data input; \u2022 billing or collection in local currency or local payment method; \u2022 Responsibility for final delivery; \u2022 provision of support services (like after-sales, repairs); or \u2022 Continuous marketing to attract customers. The tax is withheld by payment intermediaries\u2014banks, financial institutions, exchange companies, or other payment service providers\u2014who must remit it monthly by the 7th. Foreign vendors paying social media or online platforms for ads in Pakistan must also deduct and remit DPPT monthly. Exemptions apply for: \u2022 payments for goods effectively connected to a branch office in Pakistan if supplied locally; and \u2022 services received in Pakistan but rendered through a branch office. Additionally, the Act imposes tax on payments for digitally ordered goods or services supplied within Pakistan via domestic online platforms: \u2022 1% of the gross amount if paid digitally or/banking channels; \u2022 2% if paid by cash on delivery through couriers.

However, it's important to note that generating an e-way bill is not mandatory for all supplies that involve the movement of goods from one location to another. Several factors come into play when determining the obligation to generate this bill, including the value of the consignment, the distance between the points of origin and destination, the nature of the goods, and more. Moreover, different States may have specific requirements for generating e-way bills that may differ from the standard provisions outlined by the Central Government. Taxmann\u2019s E-way Bill Tool can help you evaluate whether an e-way bill is required for a specific transaction. What's even more convenient is that this tool is user-friendly and can be used by anyone, even those with limited knowledge of the GST.\nCan a user find the relevant Notification and Rule Number for e-way bill from this tool?\nYes. You will get the relevant Rule Number of the CGST Rules, 2017 and relevant Notification Numbers on which the result is based. Please fill in all the necessary information from the drop down menu and select \u2018Apply\u2019. Upon reaching the result page, you will get the references of relevant notifications and rules.\nHow is the e-way bill generated?\nE-way bills can be generated online through the GST portal (https://ewaybillgst.gov.in/). Users need to log in, provide the relevant details of the consignment, and generate the e-way bill. The e-way bill is required to be filled in Form GST EWB-01 which is divided into two parts i.e. Part A and Part B. In Part A, the details relating to the supply and movement of goods are furnished. Once details in Part A of the e-way bill are furnished, a unique number is generated through which the details in Part B of the form can be updated. Part B of the form, where the transport details are furnished, helps in the generation of the e-way bill. The e-way bill number would be generated on the e-way bill portal only upon the successful furnishing of information in both Part A and Part B.\nWho is required to generate e-way bill?\nEvery registered person, who causes movement of goods, needs to generate the e-way bill. If the registered person is unable to generate the e-way bill, the transporter who transports the goods can generate the e-way bill. If the movement is caused by an unregistered person, he may at his option generate the e-way bill.\nCan e-way bill be modified or edited?\nThe e-way bill once generated, cannot be edited or modified.

The rules for the interpretation of First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, including the Section and Chapter Notes and the General Explanatory Notes of the First Schedule shall, so far as may be, apply to the interpretation of the rate notification of goods.\nHSN for services to be determined by referring to Service classification Code provided in Notification No. 11/2017-CT(R).\nStep 2: Then the rate is required to be determined based on applicable HSN by referring to the rate notifications.\nNote: GST Rate finder is facilitated by Taxmann for the user\u2019s ready reference.\nWhy do I need a GST Rate Finder?\nIndian Taxation System has categorized over 1211 goods for levy of GST under 6 broad categories or tax-slabs. These are 0% or No Tax, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. It is very important to know in which of these categories your product or good has been classified. You can easily find that with a search using commonly used word for the product. This Rate Finder Tool can be used to find the HSN Code for the goods or products for invoicing purposes.\nWhat is HSN Code in GST?\nHarmonized System of Nomenclature or HSN, is a 6-digit uniform code allotted to over 5000 goods and is universally accepted. Conceived and developed by World Customs Organization (WCO) in order to classify goods from all over the world in a systematic way. Adopted in over 200 countries, it covers around 98% of all goods produced and traded in, under its ambit.\nHow do I interpret the HSN Code for a good/product?\nGoing through the universal HSN Code list, it is clear that every good is assigned with a 6-digit code which is unique in nature. In India, there are 2 more digits added to these 6 for further classification.\r\n\r\nLet's understand the HSN Code meaning through an example. Overall there are 21 sections comprising 99 chapters divided into 1244 headings and 5224 sub-headings. 09024020 is the code for Black Tea sold as leaf in bulk, where 09 is the Chapter, 02 is the heading and 40 is the product code for Black Tea. The last 2 digits of 20 is code allotted by Indian taxation system for Black Tea sold in leaf form and in bulk. Had it been Black Tea bags then the last two digits of the HSN code would have been replaced with 40 instead of 20.\nWhat is SAC Code?\nThe SAC Code meaning can be easily understood in the light of HSN Code which is a classification rule for goods. SAC code list classifies the services which come under the ambit of GST rate list.\nWhat is the relation of HSN Code with GST Rate?\nFor an accurate levy of GST rates prevalent in India, correct HSN or SAC code is necessary during Return filing. This would ensure seamless compliance of GST rules. Taxmann\u2019s One Solution offers hassle-free experience where all you have to do is to choose the correct HSN/SAC Code for goods or services, while migrating to GST software. Subsequently these details would be auto-populated wherever deemed necessary.\nIs HSN Code mandatory for me?\nBusinesses dealing with import/export of good are mandatory to use the 8-digit HSN Code.

Here are some detailed steps to help you understand how\nto use this calculator: Step 1: Select the\nAssessment Year The first step is to\nselect the assessment year you want to calculate your tax liability. The\nassessment year is when you file your tax returns declaring the income earned\nduring the previous year.
